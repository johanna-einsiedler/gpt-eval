You are an excellent examiner of Agents and Business Managers of Artists, Performers, and Athletes capabilities. The overall objective is to evaluate, via a practical online exam without a time limit, whether Agents and Business Managers of Artists, Performers, and Athletes can Send samples of clients' work and other promotional material to potential employers to obtain auditions, sponsorships, or endorsement deals.

Task ID: 21163.0

Your assignment is to determine if it is possible to design a meaningful exam for this task that can be performed remotely and to identify the required tools and materials for the evaluation. Remember that all tool and material assessments must be made with respect to the specific context of the given task and occupation.

**Definitions:**
- **Tools:** Software or applications (e.g., Python, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Image Generators) that the candidate needs to use to complete the test.
- **Materials:** Digital content (e.g., CSV files, PDFs, images, audio files, virtual lab environments) that form part of the test content.
- **Submission Requirements:** The format(s) of the files the candidate must use when submitting their solution. The simplest format is **answering questions with exact answers**, but you may also require one or more files:  
  - `.md` (for text-based submissions, e.g., a detailed write-up)  
  - `.csv` (for data or spreadsheets)  
  - `.py` (for code in Python)


**Instructions:**

1. **Remote Feasibility:**  
   Evaluate whether the task can be performed online/remotely or if it requires in-person presence.
   - **If the task requires in-person presence:**  
     - Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": false`
     - For all other fields (tools and materials), output `""NA""` as the value.
   - **If the task can be performed remotely:**  
     - Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": true` and continue with the evaluation.

2. **Tools Required:**  
    For each tool listed below, assess its necessity for carrying out the task (Send samples of clients' work and other promotional material to potential employers to obtain auditions, sponsorships, or endorsement deals.) in the role of Agents and Business Managers of Artists, Performers, and Athletes. Choose from the following options:
   - Not Required
   - Required
   
   Evaluate the following tools:
   - ""coding/Python"":
   - ""Excel"":
   - ""Word"":
   - ""PDF viewer"":
   - ""PowerPoint"":
   - ""Image Generator"":
   - ""Web Browser"":
   - ""Other"": (Should be ""NA"" unless it is impossible to do this task with the tools above and a different tool is needed, specify the tool name and its classification if so.)

3. **Materials Required:**  
    For each material listed below, determine whether it is required as a component of the test to evaluate Agents and Business Managers of Artists, Performers, and Athletes's ability to perform the task (Send samples of clients' work and other promotional material to potential employers to obtain auditions, sponsorships, or endorsement deals.). Choose from the following options:
   - Required
   - Not required

   Evaluate the following materials:
   - ""Text Instructions"":
   - ""Text PDF reports, books, etc"":
   - ""Data, CSV"":
   - ""Images, PNG/JPG, etc"":
   - ""Audio files mp3"":
   - ""Audio files mp4"":
   - ""Virtual labs or sandbox environments"":
    - ""Other"": (If the materials above are not enough and a different file format is needed, specify the material name and its classification; otherwise, use ""NA"".)

4. **Submission Requirements**
If `""can_be_performed_remotely"" = true`, specify how the candidate should submit their work. Because we prefer to evaluate them through questions with exact short answers, that is listed first. If question-answering alone cannot fully assess the candidate, require one or more of the additional file types.

For each item, choose:
- **Required**
- **Not Required**
- **NA** (if not relevant)

These are the only allowed options:
- `""exact_answer_questions""` (set direct answers, no file)
- `""md""` (text-based submission)
- `""csv""` (data or spreadsheets)
- `""py""` (Python code)

5. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**  
   Include a brief chain-of-thought explanation (in no more than 150 words) for your evaluations. If you choose to include this, add it in a separate field named `""chain_of_thought""`.  
   **Important:** Ensure that the final output adheres strictly to the JSON format provided and does not include any extra commentary outside of the designated JSON fields.

**Output Requirement:**  
Your response must be in valid JSON format following the structure provided below. Do not include any extra text or commentary outside of this JSON. The ""/"" delimit the options you can choose from

**Expected JSON Structure:**

## Explanation of Correct Answers

### Question 1: Essential components for acting submission package
**Correct Answer: [""A"", ""B"", ""C""]** (Headshot, Resume, Demo reel)
- **Explanation**: These three elements form the industry standard for acting submissions. The headshot provides casting directors with the actor's appearance, the resume details their experience and skills, and the demo reel demonstrates their on-camera abilities. The other options (personal biography, social media statistics, and references) are supplementary but not considered essential for initial submissions.

### Question 2: Standard maximum length for music demo
**Correct Answer: ""3""** (3 minutes)
- **Explanation**: Industry standard for music demos to record labels typically recommends 2-3 minutes per track, with 3 minutes being the generally accepted maximum length. This provides enough time to showcase the artist's abilities while respecting the time constraints of busy A&R representatives.

### Question 3: Ranking promotional materials for athletes
**Correct Answer: [""Performance statistics"", ""Professional photos"", ""Previous endorsement history"", ""Social media engagement metrics"", ""Personal story/background""]**
- **Explanation**: Performance statistics are the most critical for athletes as they directly demonstrate athletic achievement. Professional photos are second as they show marketability. Previous endorsement history demonstrates commercial viability. Social media metrics, while increasingly important, are still secondary to proven performance. Personal story, while valuable for marketing, is typically leveraged after initial interest is established.

### Question 4: Matching submission methods to use cases
**Correct Answer: {""A"": ""1"", ""B"": ""2"", ""C"": ""3"", ""D"": ""4""}**
- **Explanation**: 
  - Email (A) is appropriate for casting directors with file restrictions (1)
  - Physical press kits (B) remain standard for traditional publishing houses (2)
  - Online portfolio links (C) are efficient for sending to multiple talent buyers simultaneously (3)
  - Talent agency systems (D) typically require standardized formatting (4)

### Question 5: Elements of a ""tailored submission package""
**Correct Answer: [""A"", ""C"", ""E""]** (Materials customized for specific opportunity, Highlighting relevant experience, Addressing submission to decision maker)
- **Explanation**: A tailored package focuses on customization for the specific opportunity, highlighting only the most relevant experience, and addressing materials directly to the decision maker. Options B, D, and F represent misconceptions about what constitutes professional tailoring.

### Question 6: Standard audio format for voice demos
**Correct Answer: ""MP3""**
- **Explanation**: MP3 is the industry standard for voice demos as it provides a good balance between audio quality and file size, making it easy to email and download while maintaining sufficient fidelity for evaluation purposes.

### Question 7: Standard number of works for visual artist portfolio
**Correct Answer: ""10""**
- **Explanation**: The industry standard for initial gallery submissions typically recommends 8-12 pieces, with 10 being the generally accepted optimal number that shows range without overwhelming reviewers.

### Question 8: Critical components of an effective cover letter
**Correct Answer: [""A"", ""B"", ""E""]** (Client's qualifications, Specific reason for contact, Clear call to action)
- **Explanation**: Effective cover letters highlight relevant qualifications (A), explain specifically why you're contacting this particular employer (B), and include a clear call to action (E). Options C, D, and F represent elements that are either premature or excessive for an initial submission.

### Question 9: Standard timeframe before follow-up
**Correct Answer: ""5""** (5 business days)
- **Explanation**: Industry standard practice is to wait 5 business days (one week) before following up on submissions. This provides adequate time for review while demonstrating professional follow-through.

### Question 10: True statement about promotional materials
**Correct Answer: ""C""** (Materials should be tailored to the specific opportunity and employer's needs)
- **Explanation**: Tailoring materials to specific opportunities is essential for success as it demonstrates professionalism and understanding of the employer's unique needs. The other options represent common misconceptions or unprofessional practices.

## Passing Criteria

To pass this basic examination, candidates must:
- Score at least 7 out of 10 questions correctly (70%)
- Correctly answer at least one question from each of the following categories:
  - Material selection (Questions 1, 2, 3)
  - Submission methods (Questions 4, 6, 7)
  - Professional communication (Questions 5, 8, 9, 10)

## Validation Methods for Questions with Multiple Valid Approaches

### Question 3 (Ranking promotional materials)
While the provided ranking represents the standard industry approach, there may be valid variations depending on the specific sport or market. Alternative valid rankings should maintain:
- Performance statistics must be in positions 1 or 2
- Personal story/background should not be higher than position 4
- Professional photos must be in positions 1-3

### Question 7 (Number of portfolio works)
A range of 8-12 works is considered valid, with 10 being optimal. Programmatically accept answers in this range.

### Question 9 (Follow-up timeframe)
While 5 business days is standard, a range of 3-7 business days may be accepted as reasonable, with stronger preference given to 4-6 days.

## Validation Script Example (Pseudocode)

```
function validateAnswer(questionNumber, candidateAnswer, answerKey) {
  switch(questionNumber) {
    case 3:
      if (candidateAnswer[0] == ""Performance statistics"" || candidateAnswer[1] == ""Performance statistics"")

**Definitions:**
- **Tools:** Software or applications (e.g., Python, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Image Generators) that the candidate needs to use to complete the test.
- **Materials:** Digital content (e.g., CSV files, PDFs, images, audio files, virtual lab environments) that form part of the test content.
- **Submission Requirements:** The format(s) of the files the candidate must use when submitting their solution. The simplest format is **answering questions with exact answers**, but you may also require one or more files:  
  - `.md` (for text-based submissions, e.g., a detailed write-up)  
  - `.csv` (for data or spreadsheets)  
  - `.py` (for code in Python)


**Instructions:**

1. **Remote Feasibility:**  
   Evaluate whether the task can be performed online/remotely or if it requires in-person presence.
   - **If the task requires in-person presence:**  
     - Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": false`
     - For all other fields (tools and materials), output `""NA""` as the value.
   - **If the task can be performed remotely:**  
     - Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": true` and continue with the evaluation.

## Validation Approach for Multiple Valid Answers

Since industry trends questions can have multiple valid answers, evaluate submissions using this approach:

1. **Verification Check:** For any claimed fact, trend, or deal, verify it occurred within the specified timeframe (12-18 months).

2. **Comprehensiveness Check:** Evaluate whether the answer addresses all aspects of the question (e.g., both identification of trends AND explanation of impacts).

3. **Specificity Check:** Evaluate the level of detail provided (specific figures, names, dates, terms).

4. **Relevance Check:** Evaluate whether the example directly relates to the question topic.

5. **Knowledge Depth Check:** Evaluate whether the answer demonstrates industry-specific knowledge versus general awareness.

**Programmatic Validation Pseudo-code:**

```
function validateAnswer(candidateAnswer, questionKey):
    score = 0
    maxScore = 6.25
    
    # Initialize counters
    keyPointsIdentified = 0
    totalKeyPoints = len(questionKey[""key_points""])
    
    # Check each key point
    for keyPoint in questionKey[""key_points""]:
        if containsKeyPoint(candidateAnswer, keyPoint):
            keyPointsIdentified += 1
    
    # Calculate percentage of key points covered
    coveragePercentage = keyPointsIdentified / totalKeyPoints
    
    # Apply custom validation rules from notes
    if ""validation_notes"" in questionKey:
        adjustedScore = applyCustomValidation(candidateAnswer, 
                                             questionKey[""validation_notes""], 
                                             coveragePercentage * maxScore)
        return adjustedScore
    
    # Default scoring based on coverage percentage
    return coveragePercentage * maxScore

function containsKeyPoint(answer, keyPoint):
    # This would implement semantic matching rather than exact matching
    # Using NLP techniques to identify semantic equivalence
    return semanticMatchScore(answer, keyPoint) > 0.7

function applyCustomValidation(answer, validationNotes, baseScore):
    # Apply specific validation rules from notes
    # This would implement custom logic for special cases
    # Return adjusted score
    return adjustedBaseScore
```

The exam has a total of 100 points divided equally across 16 questions (6.25 points per question).

**Scoring System:**
- Full credit (6.25 points): Answer contains all key points with accurate details
- Partial credit (3-5 points): Answer contains most key points but may lack some specificity or detail
- Minimal credit (1-2 points): Answer demonstrates awareness but lacks specific details or contains inaccuracies
- No credit (0 points): Answer is missing, completely inaccurate, or irrelevant

**Passing Thresholds:**
- Pass with Distinction: 85-100 points
- Pass: 70-84 points
- Conditional Pass (requires follow-up interview): 60-69 points
- Fail: Below 60 points

## Validation Approach for Multiple Valid Answers

Since industry trends questions can have multiple valid answers, evaluate submissions using this approach:

1. **Verification Check:** For any claimed fact, trend, or deal, verify it occurred within the specified timeframe (12-18 months).

2. **Comprehensiveness Check:** Evaluate whether the answer addresses all aspects of the question (e.g., both identification of trends AND explanation of impacts).

3. **Specificity Check:** Evaluate the level of detail provided (specific figures, names, dates, terms).

4. **Relevance Check:** Evaluate whether the example directly relates to the question topic.

5. **Knowledge Depth Check:** Evaluate whether the answer demonstrates industry-specific knowledge versus general awareness.

**Programmatic Validation Pseudo-code:**

```
function validateAnswer(candidateAnswer, questionKey):
    score = 0
    maxScore = 6.25
    
    # Initialize counters
    keyPointsIdentified = 0
    totalKeyPoints = len(questionKey[""key_points""])
    
    # Check each key point
    for keyPoint in questionKey[""key_points""]:
        if containsKeyPoint(candidateAnswer, keyPoint):
            keyPointsIdentified += 1
    
    # Calculate percentage of key points covered
    coveragePercentage = keyPointsIdentified / totalKeyPoints
    
    # Apply custom validation rules from notes
    if ""validation_notes"" in questionKey:
        adjustedScore = applyCustomValidation(candidateAnswer, 
                                             questionKey[""validation_notes""], 
                                             coveragePercentage * maxScore)
        return adjustedScore
    
    # Default scoring based on coverage percentage
    return coveragePercentage * maxScore

function containsKeyPoint(answer, keyPoint):
    # This would implement semantic matching rather than exact matching
    # Using NLP techniques to identify semantic equivalence
    return semanticMatchScore(answer, keyPoint) > 0.7

function applyCustomValidation(answer, validationNotes, baseScore):
    # Apply specific validation rules from notes
    # This would implement custom logic for special cases
    # Return adjusted score
    return adjustedBaseScore
```

This approach allows for flexibility in accepting different valid answers while maintaining consistent evaluation standards. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, 
placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. The file 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","I'll create a Python script `task_evaluation.py` that evaluates a candidate's submission against an answer key and generates a results file with the overall score.

This script:

1. Loads the candidate submission (`test_submission.json`) and answer key (`answer_key.json`)
2. Evaluates each answer against the key points in the answer key
3. Implements a simple semantic matching function to check if key points are covered
4. Applies custom validation rules based on the validation notes
5. Calculates the overall score as a percentage
6. Determines the pass status based on the thresholds
7. Saves the results to `test_results.json`

The implementation uses a simplified approach to semantic matching. In a production environment, you might want to use more sophisticated NLP techniques such as word embeddings or transformer models for better matching accuracy.",2,1228,1228,13-1011.00,Keep informed of industry trends and deals.,Core,"Agents and Business Managers of Artists, Performers, and Athletes",E2,E2,E2,False,T3,0.0,0.5,1.0,0.75,E2,13,Business and Financial Operations Occupations,1.0,1,True,True

## Explanation of Correct Answers

### Section 1: Terminology and Concepts

**Q1: Which financial statement best reflects a client's revenue and expenses over a specific period?**
- Correct Answer: **b) Income Statement**
- Explanation: The Income Statement is specifically designed to show revenue earned and expenses incurred during a defined period, making it the appropriate statement for tracking financial performance over time. The Balance Sheet shows the financial position at a specific point in time, the Cash Flow Statement tracks cash movements, and the Statement of Retained Earnings shows changes in equity.

**Q2: In entertainment accounting, which of the following is NOT considered deferred revenue?**
- Correct Answer: **c) Performance fees for completed shows**
- Explanation: Deferred revenue represents payments received before services are rendered. Performance fees for completed shows represent earned revenue since the performance has already occurred. The other options describe situations where payment is received before the corresponding service or product is delivered.

**Q3: What accounting method is typically recommended for tracking sporadic income such as royalties and residuals?**
- Correct Answer: **b) Accrual basis**
- Explanation: The accrual method is preferred for tracking sporadic income like royalties because it records revenue when earned (regardless of when payment is received), providing a more accurate picture of financial performance. This is especially important for entertainment professionals with varied income streams.

**Q4: Which of the following statements about a client's Chart of Accounts is correct?**
- Correct Answer: **b) It organizes financial transactions into categories**
- Explanation: A Chart of Accounts is a listing of all accounts used to categorize and organize financial transactions. It includes both revenue and expense accounts (not just revenue), is useful for businesses of all sizes (not just public companies), and does not need to follow IRS-prescribed formats.

**Q5: When preparing quarterly statements for clients, which of these is NOT a primary financial statement?**
- Correct Answer: **c) Accounts Receivable Aging**
- Explanation: While an Accounts Receivable Aging report is an important supplemental report, it is not considered one of the primary financial statements. The primary statements are the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Statement of Cash Flows.

### Section 2: Financial Statement Preparation

**Q6: Using the provided client data, calculate the Net Income for Q1 2023.**
- Correct Answer: **82000**
- Calculation:
  - Total Revenue: $345,000
  - Total Expenses: $263,000
  - Net Income = $345,000 - $263,000 = $82,000

**Q7: Based on the information below, prepare a simple balance sheet.**
- Correct Answer:
  - **totalAssets: 645000**
  - **totalLiabilities: 240000**
  - **netWorth: 405000**
- Calculation:
  - Total Assets = Cash + Accounts Receivable + Investment Assets + Property/Equipment
  - Total Assets = $175,000 + $95,000 + $250,000 + $125,000 = $645,000
  - Total Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Credit Card Debt + Loans Payable
  - Total Liabilities = $45,000 + $15,000 + $180,000 = $240,000
  - Net Worth (Equity) = Total Assets - Total Liabilities
  - Net Worth = $645,000 - $240,000 = $405,000

**Q8: Calculate the Operating Expense Ratio.**
- Correct Answer: **0.44**
- Calculation:
  - Total Operating Expenses = Agent Fees + Legal Fees + Marketing Expenses + Administrative Costs + Travel Expenses
  - Total Operating Expenses = $45,000 + $30,000 + $65,000 + $25,000 + $35,000 = $200,000
  - Operating Expense Ratio = Total Operating Expenses ÷ Gross Income
  - Operating Expense Ratio = $200,000 ÷ $450,000 = 0.444... (rounded to 0.44)

**Q9: Determine the Accounts Receivable turnover ratio for the quarter.**
- Correct Answer: **6.00**
- Calculation:
  - Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) ÷ 2
  - Average Accounts Receivable = ($85,000 + $95,000) ÷ 2 = $90,000
  - Accounts Receivable Turnover = Total Credit Sales ÷ Average Accounts Receivable
  - Accounts Receivable Turnover = $540,000 ÷ $90,000 = 6

**Q10: Calculate the client's liquid asset ratio.**
- Correct Answer: **2.43**
- Calculation:
  - Liquid Assets = Cash + Money Market Accounts + Accounts Receivable
  - Liquid Assets = $125,000 + $75,000 + $45,000 = $245,000
  - Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Credit Card Balance + Quarterly Tax Payment
  - Current Liabilities = $35,000 + $25,000 + $55,000 = $115,000
  - Liquid Asset Ratio = Liquid Assets ÷ Current Liabilities
  - Liquid Asset Ratio = $245,000 ÷ $115,000 = 2.13 (rounded to 2.13)
  - NOTE: This should be 2.13, not 2.43 as shown in the answer key. The answer key has an error.

### Section 3: Revenue Recognition and Expense Categorization

**Q11: Which category would you assign for a client's voice-over work for an animated film that has not yet been released?**
- Correct Answer: **b) Deferred Revenue**
- Explanation: If payment has been received but the film hasn't been released, the revenue is considered deferred since the performance obligation hasn't been fully satisfied. This is consistent with accrual accounting principles for entertainment industry contracts.

**Q12: Identify the total amount that should be categorized as ""Professional Development Expenses"" for Q1 2023.**
- Correct Answer: **9700**
- Calculation:
  - Acting coach: $3,500
  - Industry conference registration: $1,200
  - Script consultation: $2,000
  - Dance classes: $1,800
  - Industry publication subscriptions: $450
  - Talent showcase fee: $750
  - Total Professional Development Expenses = $3,500 + $1,200 + $2,000 + $1,800 + $450 + $750 = $9,700

**Q13: Which of the following client expenses would NOT typically be tax-deductible as a business expense?**
- Correct Answer: **b) Personal trainer**
- Explanation: A personal trainer is generally considered a personal expense unless the client can demonstrate it's directly required for a specific role or performance. The other items (stylist for an award show, headshots, and networking events) are more clearly connected to business purposes in the entertainment industry.

**Q14: What percentage of the client's income comes from passive sources?**
- Correct Answer: **22.86**
- Calculation:
  - Passive income sources = Streaming royalties + Music publishing
  - Passive income = $45,000 + $35,000 = $80,000
  - Total income = $185,000 + $45,000 + $65,000 + $35,000 + $25,000 = $355,000
  - Percentage of passive income = ($80,000 ÷ $355,000) × 100 = 22.5352% (rounded to 22.54%)
  - NOTE: The expected answer should be 22.54% or 22.54, not 22.5 as shown in the submission requirements example and not 22.86 as shown in the answer key. The answer key has an error.

**Q15: Properly allocate these client expenses.**
- Correct Answer:
  - **travel: 25000** (Private jet to performance venue)
  - **marketing: 1500** (Website maintenance)
  - **professionalFees: 15500** (Fan meet-and-greet security: $3,500 + Producer fees: $12,000)
  - **wardrobe: 4500** (Award show attire)
- Explanation: Each expense is allocated to the appropriate category based on the nature of the expense and standard industry categorization practices.

### Section 4: Compliance and Regulatory Requirements

**Q16: When should estimated quarterly tax payments be submitted?**
- Correct Answer: **[""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d""]** (All options)
- Explanation: Estimated quarterly tax payments are due on January 15, April 15, June 15, and September 15 (which match all options provided). These are the standard IRS deadlines for quarterly estimated tax payments for individuals.

**Q17: Which form must be issued to a client who earned more than $600 in royalties during the tax year?**
- Correct Answer: **b) 1099-MISC**
- Explanation: For royalty payments of $10 or more, the payer must issue a 1099-MISC to the recipient. Form 1099-NEC is for non-employee compensation, W-2 is for employees, and 1040-ES is for estimated tax payments.

**Q18: What is the standard deadline for providing clients with an annual income and expense statement for tax preparation purposes?**
- Correct Answer: **b) January 31**
- Explanation: January 31 is the deadline for furnishing various information returns (including 1099s) to recipients. This makes it a standard deadline for providing annual financial statements to clients for tax preparation.

**Q19: For a client with international income sources, which of these statements is TRUE?**
- Correct Answer: **b) Foreign taxes paid can potentially offset US tax obligations**
- Explanation: Through the Foreign Tax Credit or the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, taxes paid to foreign governments can often be used to reduce US tax liability. The other statements are incorrect: foreign income is generally subject to US taxation for US citizens and residents, must be reported on US returns, and should be converted to USD for reporting purposes.

**Q20: What financial documentation should be maintained for a client who receives royalty payments?**
- Correct Answer: **[""a"", ""b"", ""c""]**
- Explanation: For clients receiving royalty payments, it's essential to maintain copies of royalty statements from each source, reconciliations of payments received against statements, and documentation of withholding taxes. Proof of copyright ownership, while important for other reasons, is not directly related to financial record-keeping for royalty payments and was included as a distractor.

## Passing Criteria

The exam has 20 questions across four sections, with a total possible score of 100 points.

**Point Allocation:**
- Section 1 (Terminology): 5 questions × 4 points each = 20 points
- Section 2 (Financial Statements): 5 questions × 6 points each = 30 points
- Section 3 (Revenue & Expenses): 5 questions × 5 points each = 25 points
- Section 4 (Compliance): 5 questions × 5 points each = 25 points

**Passing Threshold:** 70 points (70%)

**Partial Credit for Calculation Questions:**
- For calculation questions (Q6-Q10, Q12, Q14), award partial credit if the calculation approach is correct but there are minor arithmetic errors.
- For question 15 (expense allocation), award 1 point for each correctly categorized expense.
- For multiple selection questions (Q16, Q20), award partial credit proportional to the number of correct selections made without incorrect ones.

## Validation Approaches

### For Multiple-Choice and Selection Questions
```
function validateMultipleChoice(candidateAnswer, correctAnswer) {
    return candidateAnswer === correctAnswer;
}

function validateMultipleSelection(candidateAnswer, correctAnswer) {
    if (!Array.isArray(candidateAnswer) || !Array.isArray(correctAnswer)) return false;
    
    // Check if arrays have the same length and same elements
    if (candidateAnswer.length !== correctAnswer.length) return false;
    
    const sortedCandidate = [...candidateAnswer].sort();
    const sortedCorrect = [...correctAnswer].sort();
    
    return sortedCandidate.every((value, index) => value === sortedCorrect[index]);
}
```

### For Numerical Calculations
```
function validateNumeric(candidateAnswer, correctAnswer, tolerance = 0) {
    // For whole numbers, no tolerance needed
    if (tolerance === 0) {
        return candidateAnswer === correctAnswer;
    }
    
    // For decimals, allow for small rounding differences
    return Math.abs(candidateAnswer - correctAnswer) <= tolerance;
}
```

### For Object Responses (like balance sheet in Q7)
```
function validateObject(candidateObject, correctObject, tolerance = 0) {
    if (!candidateObject || !correctObject) return false;
    
    const candidateKeys = Object.keys(candidateObject);
    const correctKeys = Object.keys(correctObject);
    
    // Check if all required keys are present
    if (!correctKeys.every(key => candidateKeys.includes(key))) return false;
    
    // Check each value
    for (const key of correctKeys) {
        const candidateValue = candidateObject[key];
        const correctValue = correctObject[key];
        
        // For numeric values, use the numeric validator with tolerance
        if (typeof correctValue === 'number') {
            if (!validateNumeric(candidateValue, correctValue, tolerance)) return false;
        }
        // For strings or other types, use exact matching
        else if (candidateValue !== correctValue) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

### Special Case for Q14 (Percentage calculation)
In question 14, the percentage calculation should allow for minor rounding differences. The correct value should be 22.54%, but values between 22.5% and 22.6% could be accepted.

```
function validateQ14(candidateAnswer) {
    return candidateAnswer >= 22.5 && candidateAnswer <= 22.6;
}
```

### Special Case for Q20 (Document Requirements)
For question 20 about documentation requirements, the expected answer is [""a"", ""b"", ""c""]. The exam materials listed ""d"" as a distractor (proof of copyright ownership), which isn't directly related to financial record-keeping for royalty payments.","

## Explanation of Correct Answers

### Section 1: Terminology and Concepts

**Q1: Which financial statement best reflects a client's revenue and expenses over a specific period?**
- Correct Answer: **b) Income Statement**
- Explanation: The Income Statement is specifically designed to show revenue earned and expenses incurred during a defined period, making it the appropriate statement for tracking financial performance over time. The Balance Sheet shows the financial position at a specific point in time, the Cash Flow Statement tracks cash movements, and the Statement of Retained Earnings shows changes in equity.

**Q2: In entertainment accounting, which of the following is NOT considered deferred revenue?**
- Correct Answer: **c) Performance fees for completed shows**
- Explanation: Deferred revenue represents payments received before services are rendered. Performance fees for completed shows represent earned revenue since the performance has already occurred. The other options describe situations where payment is received before the corresponding service or product is delivered.

**Q3: What accounting method is typically recommended for tracking sporadic income such as royalties and residuals?**
- Correct Answer: **b) Accrual basis**
- Explanation: The accrual method is preferred for tracking sporadic income like royalties because it records revenue when earned (regardless of when payment is received), providing a more accurate picture of financial performance. This is especially important for entertainment professionals with varied income streams.

**Q4: Which of the following statements about a client's Chart of Accounts is correct?**
- Correct Answer: **b) It organizes financial transactions into categories**
- Explanation: A Chart of Accounts is a listing of all accounts used to categorize and organize financial transactions. It includes both revenue and expense accounts (not just revenue), is useful for businesses of all sizes (not just public companies), and does not need to follow IRS-prescribed formats.

**Q5: When preparing quarterly statements for clients, which of these is NOT a primary financial statement?**
- Correct Answer: **c) Accounts Receivable Aging**
- Explanation: While an Accounts Receivable Aging report is an important supplemental report, it is not considered one of the primary financial statements. The primary statements are the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Statement of Cash Flows.

### Section 2: Financial Statement Preparation

**Q6: Using the provided client data, calculate the Net Income for Q1 2023.**
- Correct Answer: **82000**
- Calculation:
  - Total Revenue: $345,000
  - Total Expenses: $263,000
  - Net Income = $345,000 - $263,000 = $82,000

**Q7: Based on the information below, prepare a simple balance sheet.**
- Correct Answer:
  - **totalAssets: 645000**
  - **totalLiabilities: 240000**
  - **netWorth: 405000**
- Calculation:
  - Total Assets = Cash + Accounts Receivable + Investment Assets + Property/Equipment
  - Total Assets = $175,000 + $95,000 + $250,000 + $125,000 = $645,000
  - Total Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Credit Card Debt + Loans Payable
  - Total Liabilities = $45,000 + $15,000 + $180,000 = $240,000
  - Net Worth (Equity) = Total Assets - Total Liabilities
  - Net Worth = $645,000 - $240,000 = $405,000

**Q8: Calculate the Operating Expense Ratio.**
- Correct Answer: **0.44**
- Calculation:
  - Total Operating Expenses = Agent Fees + Legal Fees + Marketing Expenses + Administrative Costs + Travel Expenses
  - Total Operating Expenses = $45,000 + $30,000 + $65,000 + $25,000 + $35,000 = $200,000
  - Operating Expense Ratio = Total Operating Expenses ÷ Gross Income
  - Operating Expense Ratio = $200,000 ÷ $450,000 = 0.444... (rounded to 0.44)

**Q9: Determine the Accounts Receivable turnover ratio for the quarter.**
- Correct Answer: **6.00**
- Calculation:
  - Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) ÷ 2
  - Average Accounts Receivable = ($85,000 + $95,000) ÷ 2 = $90,000
  - Accounts Receivable Turnover = Total Credit Sales ÷ Average Accounts Receivable
  - Accounts Receivable Turnover = $540,000 ÷ $90,000 = 6

**Q10: Calculate the client's liquid asset ratio.**
- Correct Answer: **2.43**
- Calculation:
  - Liquid Assets = Cash + Money Market Accounts + Accounts Receivable
  - Liquid Assets = $125,000 + $75,000 + $45,000 = $245,000
  - Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Credit Card Balance + Quarterly Tax Payment
  - Current Liabilities = $35,000 + $25,000 + $55,000 = $115,000
  - Liquid Asset Ratio = Liquid Assets ÷ Current Liabilities
  - Liquid Asset Ratio = $245,000 ÷ $115,000 = 2.13 (rounded to 2.13)
  - NOTE: This should be 2.13, not 2.43 as shown in the answer key. The answer key has an error.

### Section 3: Revenue Recognition and Expense Categorization

**Q11: Which category would you assign for a client's voice-over work for an animated film that has not yet been released?**
- Correct Answer: **b) Deferred Revenue**
- Explanation: If payment has been received but the film hasn't been released, the revenue is considered deferred since the performance obligation hasn't been fully satisfied. This is consistent with accrual accounting principles for entertainment industry contracts.

**Q12: Identify the total amount that should be categorized as ""Professional Development Expenses"" for Q1 2023.**
- Correct Answer: **9700**
- Calculation:
  - Acting coach: $3,500
  - Industry conference registration: $1,200
  - Script consultation: $2,000
  - Dance classes: $1,800
  - Industry publication subscriptions: $450
  - Talent showcase fee: $750
  - Total Professional Development Expenses = $3,500 + $1,200 + $2,000 + $1,800 + $450 + $750 = $9,700

**Q13: Which of the following client expenses would NOT typically be tax-deductible as a business expense?**
- Correct Answer: **b) Personal trainer**
- Explanation: A personal trainer is generally considered a personal expense unless the client can demonstrate it's directly required for a specific role or performance. The other items (stylist for an award show, headshots, and networking events) are more clearly connected to business purposes in the entertainment industry.

**Q14: What percentage of the client's income comes from passive sources?**
- Correct Answer: **22.86**
- Calculation:
  - Passive income sources = Streaming royalties + Music publishing
  - Passive income = $45,000 + $35,000 = $80,000
  - Total income = $185,000 + $45,000 + $65,000 + $35,000 + $25,000 = $355,000
  - Percentage of passive income = ($80,000 ÷ $355,000) × 100 = 22.5352% (rounded to 22.54%)
  - NOTE: The expected answer should be 22.54% or 22.54, not 22.5 as shown in the submission requirements example and not 22.86 as shown in the answer key. The answer key has an error.

**Q15: Properly allocate these client expenses.**
- Correct Answer:
  - **travel: 25000** (Private jet to performance venue)
  - **marketing: 1500** (Website maintenance)
  - **professionalFees: 15500** (Fan meet-and-greet security: $3,500 + Producer fees: $12,000)
  - **wardrobe: 4500** (Award show attire)
- Explanation: Each expense is allocated to the appropriate category based on the nature of the expense and standard industry categorization practices.

### Section 4: Compliance and Regulatory Requirements

**Q16: When should estimated quarterly tax payments be submitted?**
- Correct Answer: **[""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d""]** (All options)
- Explanation: Estimated quarterly tax payments are due on January 15, April 15, June 15, and September 15 (which match all options provided). These are the standard IRS deadlines for quarterly estimated tax payments for individuals.

**Q17: Which form must be issued to a client who earned more than $600 in royalties during the tax year?**
- Correct Answer: **b) 1099-MISC**
- Explanation: For royalty payments of $10 or more, the payer must issue a 1099-MISC to the recipient. Form 1099-NEC is for non-employee compensation, W-2 is for employees, and 1040-ES is for estimated tax payments.

**Q18: What is the standard deadline for providing clients with an annual income and expense statement for tax preparation purposes?**
- Correct Answer: **b) January 31**
- Explanation: January 31 is the deadline for furnishing various information returns (including 1099s) to recipients. This makes it a standard deadline for providing annual financial statements to clients for tax preparation.

**Q19: For a client with international income sources, which of these statements is TRUE?**
- Correct Answer: **b) Foreign taxes paid can potentially offset US tax obligations**
- Explanation: Through the Foreign Tax Credit or the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, taxes paid to foreign governments can often be used to reduce US tax liability. The other statements are incorrect: foreign income is generally subject to US taxation for US citizens and residents, must be reported on US returns, and should be converted to USD for reporting purposes.

**Q20: What financial documentation should be maintained for a client who receives royalty payments?**
- Correct Answer: **[""a"", ""b"", ""c""]**
- Explanation: For clients receiving royalty payments, it's essential to maintain copies of royalty statements from each source, reconciliations of payments received against statements, and documentation of withholding taxes. Proof of copyright ownership, while important for other reasons, is not directly related to financial record-keeping for royalty payments and was included as a distractor.

## Passing Criteria

The exam has 20 questions across four sections, with a total possible score of 100 points.

**Point Allocation:**
- Section 1 (Terminology): 5 questions × 4 points each = 20 points
- Section 2 (Financial Statements): 5 questions × 6 points each = 30 points
- Section 3 (Revenue & Expenses): 5 questions × 5 points each = 25 points
- Section 4 (Compliance): 5 questions × 5 points each = 25 points

**Passing Threshold:** 70 points (70%)

**Partial Credit for Calculation Questions:**
- For calculation questions (Q6-Q10, Q12, Q14), award partial credit if the calculation approach is correct but there are minor arithmetic errors.
- For question 15 (expense allocation), award 1 point for each correctly categorized expense.
- For multiple selection questions (Q16, Q20), award partial credit proportional to the number of correct selections made without incorrect ones.

## Validation Approaches

### For Multiple-Choice and Selection Questions
```
function validateMultipleChoice(candidateAnswer, correctAnswer) {
    return candidateAnswer === correctAnswer;
}

function validateMultipleSelection(candidateAnswer, correctAnswer) {
    if (!Array.isArray(candidateAnswer) || !Array.isArray(correctAnswer)) return false;
    
    // Check if arrays have the same length and same elements
    if (candidateAnswer.length !== correctAnswer.length) return false;
    
    const sortedCandidate = [...candidateAnswer].sort();
    const sortedCorrect = [...correctAnswer].sort();
    
    return sortedCandidate.every((value, index) => value === sortedCorrect[index]);
}
```

### For Numerical Calculations
```
function validateNumeric(candidateAnswer, correctAnswer, tolerance = 0) {
    // For whole numbers, no tolerance needed
    if (tolerance === 0) {
        return candidateAnswer === correctAnswer;
    }
    
    // For decimals, allow for small rounding differences
    return Math.abs(candidateAnswer - correctAnswer) <= tolerance;
}
```

### For Object Responses (like balance sheet in Q7)
```
function validateObject(candidateObject, correctObject, tolerance = 0) {
    if (!candidateObject || !correctObject) return false;
    
    const candidateKeys = Object.keys(candidateObject);
    const correctKeys = Object.keys(correctObject);
    
    // Check if all required keys are present
    if (!correctKeys.every(key => candidateKeys.includes(key))) return false;
    
    // Check each value
    for (const key of correctKeys) {
        const candidateValue = candidateObject[key];
        const correctValue = correctObject[key];
        
        // For numeric values, use the numeric validator with tolerance
        if (typeof correctValue === 'number') {
            if (!validateNumeric(candidateValue, correctValue, tolerance)) return false;
        }
        // For strings or other types, use exact matching
        else if (candidateValue !== correctValue) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

### Special Case for Q14 (Percentage calculation)
In question 14, the percentage calculation should allow for minor rounding differences. The correct value should be 22.54%, but values between 22.5% and 22.6% could be accepted.

```
function validateQ14(candidateAnswer) {
    return candidateAnswer >= 22.5 && candidateAnswer <= 22.6;
}
```

### Special Case for Q20 (Document Requirements)
For question 20 about documentation requirements, the expected answer is [""a"", ""b"", ""c""]. The exam materials listed ""d"" as a distractor (proof of copyright ownership), which isn't directly related to financial record-keeping for royalty payments. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, 
placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. The file 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","I'll create a Python script that evaluates a candidate's test submission by comparing it with an answer key and calculating the overall score percentage. Here's the implementation:

## Your assignment:
- If the exam doesn't require any additional material, just respond with ""No material required"".
- Else create synthetic test materials (CSV contents, datasets, etc.) that have predictable outcomes. Include the actual content to be provided to candidates and ensure all materials have clear identifiers, labels, or pre-defined categories that prevent ambiguity.

IMPORTANT: When designing the test, eliminate any opportunities for candidates to make arbitrary choices (like custom account codes, naming conventions, or classification systems) that would complicate evaluation. Either:
- Provide pre-defined structures/codes that must be used, or
- Design questions with objectively verifiable numerical/text answers that don't depend on the candidate's approach

```

> Note: For Question 5, multiple valid solutions exist. The validation section below addresses this.

## Explanation of Correct Answers

### Question 1
- Red Delicious: 8,500 lbs ÷ 42 lbs per case = 202.38 cases → 203 cases
- Gala: 7,200 lbs ÷ 42 lbs per case = 171.43 cases → 172 cases
- Granny Smith: 5,300 lbs ÷ 38 lbs per case = 139.47 cases → 140 cases
- Must round up to whole cases since partial cases cannot be ordered

### Question 2
- Required: 18,500 lbs of Roma tomatoes with minimum 6.2% solids
- Supplier C's tomatoes don't meet specifications (only 6.1% solids)
- Cost-effective approach: Use Supplier B (lowest qualified price at $0.78/lb) to capacity (9,000 lbs), then use Supplier A for remaining 9,500 lbs
- Total cost: (9,000 lbs × $0.78) + (9,500 lbs × $0.82) = $7,020 + $7,790 = $14,810

### Question 3
- Total order requirement: 28 + 16 + 35 = 79 tons
- Current inventory: 14 tons
- Additional tons needed: 79 - 14 = 65 tons
- Primary supplier: 40 tons (2-week delivery)
- Secondary supplier: 25 tons (3-week notice)
- This fulfills all orders with no excess inventory while ensuring timely delivery

### Question 4
- Strawberries: 420 lbs ÷ 8 lbs per flat = 52.5 flats → 53 flats
- Blueberries: 280 lbs ÷ 5 lbs per container = 56 containers
- Raspberries: 160 lbs ÷ 4 lbs per container = 40 containers
- Exact weekly delivery quantities must be calculated with rounding up to whole containers

### Question 5
Multiple solutions exist, but all must:
1. Meet the required volume for each grade (860, 520, and 340 gallons)
2. Use no more than 40 containers total
3. Use only available container sizes (55-gallon drums, 35-gallon drums, 5-gallon containers)

The solution provided optimizes for using larger containers where possible, minimizing handling needs.

## Passing Criteria
- Total points possible: 100 points (20 points per question)
- Passing score: 70 points (70%)

### Point Breakdown Per Question
- Correct product selection and meeting minimum requirements: 6 points
- Accurate quantity calculation: 8 points
- Logical reasoning and justification: 4 points
- Appropriate format and structure of answer: 2 points

## Validation Methods for Multiple Valid Solutions

### Question 5 Validation
For Question 5, multiple valid combinations of containers could work. A solution is valid if:

1. Total gallons per grade match requirements:
   - Extra Virgin: Containers must sum to exactly 860 gallons
   - Virgin: Containers must sum to exactly 520 gallons
   - Pure: Containers must sum to exactly 340 gallons

2. Total container count ≤ 40:
   - Count of all 55-gallon drums +
   - Count of all 35-gallon drums +
   - Count of all 5-gallon containers ≤ 40

3. Container counts must be whole numbers ≥ 0

### Validation Formulas
For each olive oil grade (g), let:
- D₅₅ᵍ = number of 55-gallon drums

Based on your supplier data, Red Delicious and Gala apples come in 42-lb cases, while Granny Smith comes in 38-lb cases. Suppliers require orders in full cases only (no partial cases).

Determine the exact number of cases to order for each apple variety to fulfill the grocery chain's requirements without significant excess.

### Question 2
A food processor has contracted for 18,500 lbs of tomatoes for pasta sauce production in the coming month. Their specifications call for Roma tomatoes with 6.2% minimum solids content.

You have three suppliers with the following availability:
- Supplier A: Roma tomatoes, 6.4% solids, $0.82/lb, 12,000 lbs available
- Supplier B: Roma tomatoes, 6.3% solids, $0.78/lb, 9,000 lbs available
- Supplier C: Roma tomatoes, 6.1% solids, $0.76/lb, 8,000 lbs available

Determine which supplier(s) you would order from and in what quantities to meet the processor's requirements at the lowest total cost while maintaining required specifications.

### Question 3
Your company supplies organic feed grain to livestock producers. You have received these orders for next quarter:
- Dairy Farm A: 28 tons of organic corn feed
- Poultry Operation B: 16 tons of organic corn feed
- Beef Ranch C: 35 tons of organic corn feed

Your grain storage facility currently has 14 tons in inventory. Your primary supplier can deliver 40 tons within 2 weeks, and a secondary supplier can provide up to 30 tons with 3 weeks' notice.

Calculate how much grain to order from each supplier to fulfill all customer orders on time with minimum excess inventory.

### Question 4
A restaurant group has placed orders for fresh berries for their summer menu:
- 420 lbs of strawberries weekly for 6 weeks

```

> Note: For Question 5, multiple valid solutions exist. The validation section below addresses this.

## Explanation of Correct Answers

### Question 1
- Red Delicious: 8,500 lbs ÷ 42 lbs per case = 202.38 cases → 203 cases
- Gala: 7,200 lbs ÷ 42 lbs per case = 171.43 cases → 172 cases
- Granny Smith: 5,300 lbs ÷ 38 lbs per case = 139.47 cases → 140 cases
- Must round up to whole cases since partial cases cannot be ordered

### Question 2
- Required: 18,500 lbs of Roma tomatoes with minimum 6.2% solids
- Supplier C's tomatoes don't meet specifications (only 6.1% solids)
- Cost-effective approach: Use Supplier B (lowest qualified price at $0.78/lb) to capacity (9,000 lbs), then use Supplier A for remaining 9,500 lbs
- Total cost: (9,000 lbs × $0.78) + (9,500 lbs × $0.82) = $7,020 + $7,790 = $14,810

### Question 3
- Total order requirement: 28 + 16 + 35 = 79 tons
- Current inventory: 14 tons
- Additional tons needed: 79 - 14 = 65 tons
- Primary supplier: 40 tons (2-week delivery)
- Secondary supplier: 25 tons (3-week notice)
- This fulfills all orders with no excess inventory while ensuring timely delivery

### Question 4
- Strawberries: 420 lbs ÷ 8 lbs per flat = 52.5 flats → 53 flats
- Blueberries: 280 lbs ÷ 5 lbs per container = 56 containers
- Raspberries: 160 lbs ÷ 4 lbs per container = 40 containers
- Exact weekly delivery quantities must be calculated with rounding up to whole containers

### Question 5
Multiple solutions exist, but all must:
1. Meet the required volume for each grade (860, 520, and 340 gallons)
2. Use no more than 40 containers total
3. Use only available container sizes (55-gallon drums, 35-gallon drums, 5-gallon containers)

The solution provided optimizes for using larger containers where possible, minimizing handling needs.

## Passing Criteria
- Total points possible: 100 points (20 points per question)
- Passing score: 70 points (70%)

### Point Breakdown Per Question
- Correct product selection and meeting minimum requirements: 6 points
- Accurate quantity calculation: 8 points
- Logical reasoning and justification: 4 points
- Appropriate format and structure of answer: 2 points

## Validation Methods for Multiple Valid Solutions

### Question 5 Validation
For Question 5, multiple valid combinations of containers could work. A solution is valid if:

1. Total gallons per grade match requirements:
   - Extra Virgin: Containers must sum to exactly 860 gallons
   - Virgin: Containers must sum to exactly 520 gallons
   - Pure: Containers must sum to exactly 340 gallons

2. Total container count ≤ 40:
   - Count of all 55-gallon drums +
   - Count of all 35-gallon drums +
   - Count of all 5-gallon containers ≤ 40

3. Container counts must be whole numbers ≥ 0

### Validation Formulas
For each olive oil grade (g), let:
- D₅₅ᵍ = number of 55-gallon drums
- D₃₅ᵍ = number of 35-gallon drums
- C₅ᵍ = number of 5-gallon containers

The solution is valid if:
1. 55·D₅₅ᴱᵛ + 35·D₃₅ᴱᵛ + 5·C₅ᴱᵛ = 860 (Extra Virgin)
2. 55·D₅₅ⱽ + 35·D₃₅ⱽ + 5·C₅ⱽ = 520 (Virgin)
3. 55·D₅₅ᴾ + 35·D₃₅ᴾ + 5·C₅ᴾ = 340 (Pure)
4. D₅₅ᴱᵛ + D₃₅ᴱᵛ + C₅ᴱᵛ + D₅₅ⱽ + D₃₅ⱽ + C₅ⱽ + D₅₅ᴾ + D₃₅ᴾ + C₅ᴾ ≤ 40
5. All variables are non-negative integers

```

## Exam Questions

### Question 1
Define the standard quota calculation formula used by the Federal Grain Authority and explain what each variable represents.

Submit your answer as a text description in the ""answer"" field.

### Question 2
The following grain types have different quota adjustment factors:
- Wheat: 1.2
- Corn: 0.8
- Soybeans: 1.5
- Rice: 1.0

A farmer has produced 5,000 bushels of wheat and 3,000 bushels of corn. Calculate:
a) The adjusted quota volume for each crop
b) The total adjusted quota volume

Submit both answers as numerical values.

### Question 3
A regional quota system allocates grain quotas based on a farm's historical production average. Farm XYZ has the following 3-year production history:
- Year 1: 8,500 bushels
- Year 2: 7,800 bushels
- Year 3: 9,200 bushels

The quota allocation formula is: (Historical Average × 0.85) + (Current Year Production × 0.15)

If the current year production is 9,400 bushels, calculate the total quota allocation for Farm XYZ. Round to the nearest whole number.

### Question 4
A government program requires quota adjustments based on conservation practices. The base quota for a farm is 12,000 bushels. The following adjustments apply:
- Cover crop implementation: +5%
- Reduced tillage practices: +3%
- Water conservation systems: +4%

If the farm implements cover crops and water conservation systems but not reduced tillage, calculate the final adjusted quota. Round to the nearest whole number.

### Question 5
A purchasing agent has calculated the following quota allocations for five farms:

| Farm ID | Acreage | Production (bushels) | Calculated Quota (bushels) |
|---------|---------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| A-123   | 500     | 25,000               | 21,250                     |
| B-456   | 350     | 15,750               | 13,387                     |
| C-789   | 600     | 33,000               | 29,700                     |
| D-012   | 450     | 27,000               | 22,950                     |
| E-345   | 200     | 8,000                | 7,200                      |

The quota calculation formula is: Production × 0.85

Identify which farm(s) have an incorrectly calculated quota and provide the correct quota value(s).","

}
```

## Exam Questions

### Question 1
Define the standard quota calculation formula used by the Federal Grain Authority and explain what each variable represents.

Submit your answer as a text description in the ""answer"" field.

### Question 2
The following grain types have different quota adjustment factors:
- Wheat: 1.2
- Corn: 0.8
- Soybeans: 1.5
- Rice: 1.0

A farmer has produced 5,000 bushels of wheat and 3,000 bushels of corn. Calculate:
a) The adjusted quota volume for each crop
b) The total adjusted quota volume

Submit both answers as numerical values.

### Question 3
A regional quota system allocates grain quotas based on a farm's historical production average. Farm XYZ has the following 3-year production history:
- Year 1: 8,500 bushels
- Year 2: 7,800 bushels
- Year 3: 9,200 bushels

The quota allocation formula is: (Historical Average × 0.85) + (Current Year Production × 0.15)

If the current year production is 9,400 bushels, calculate the total quota allocation for Farm XYZ. Round to the nearest whole number.

### Question 4
A government program requires quota adjustments based on conservation practices. The base quota for a farm is 12,000 bushels. The following adjustments apply:
- Cover crop implementation: +5%
- Reduced tillage practices: +3%
- Water conservation systems: +4%

If the farm implements cover crops and water conservation systems but not reduced tillage, calculate the final adjusted quota. Round to the nearest whole number.

### Question 5
A purchasing agent has calculated the following quota allocations for five farms:

| Farm ID | Acreage | Production (bushels) | Calculated Quota (bushels) |
|---------|---------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| A-123   | 500     | 25,000               | 21,250                     |
| B-456   | 350     | 15,750               | 13,387                     |
| C-789   | 600     | 33,000               | 29,700                     |
| D-012   | 450     | 27,000               | 22,950                     |
| E-345   | 200     | 8,000                | 7,200                      |

The quota calculation formula is: Production × 0.85

Identify which farm(s) have an incorrectly calculated quota and provide the correct quota value(s). </instructions>

## Your assignment:
- If the exam doesn't require any additional material, just respond with ""No material required"".
- Else create synthetic test materials (CSV contents, datasets, etc.) that have predictable outcomes. Include the actual content to be provided to candidates and ensure all materials have clear identifiers, labels, or pre-defined categories that prevent ambiguity.

IMPORTANT: When designing the test, eliminate any opportunities for candidates to make arbitrary choices (like custom account codes, naming conventions, or classification systems) that would complicate evaluation. Either:
- Provide pre-defined structures/codes that must be used, or
- Design questions with objectively verifiable numerical/text answers that don't depend on the candidate's approach

## Explanation of Correct Answers

### Question 1
**Correct Answer:** A description that includes the basic formula (Q = P × AF) and explains that Q represents quota allocation, P represents production volume, and AF represents the adjustment factor based on government regulations.

**Explanation:** This question tests the candidate's fundamental understanding of quota terminology and the standard calculation method. The candidate should demonstrate knowledge that quotas are typically calculated by multiplying production by an adjustment factor determined by regulations. Accept reasonable variations in wording as long as the core formula and variable definitions are correct.

### Question 2
**Correct Answer:**
- Part A: Wheat: 6000, Corn: 2400
- Part B: 8400

**Explanation:**
- Wheat calculation: 5,000 bushels × 1.2 adjustment factor = 6,000 bushels
- Corn calculation: 3,000 bushels × 0.8 adjustment factor = 2,400 bushels  
- Total adjusted quota: 6,000 + 2,400 = 8,400 bushels

This tests the candidate's ability to apply different adjustment factors to different crop types and calculate a combined quota.

### Question 3
**Correct Answer:** 8547

**Explanation:**
1. Calculate historical average: (8,500 + 7,800 + 9,200) ÷ 3 = 8,500 bushels
2. Apply quota formula: (8,500 × 0.85) + (9,400 × 0.15)
3. Calculate: 7,225 + 1,410 = 8,635
4. Round to nearest whole number: 8,547 (incorrect - should be 8,635)

**Note to evaluator:** The correct answer is 8,635. There appears to be an error in the answer key. The calculation should be:
- Historical average: (8,500 + 7,800 + 9,200) ÷ 3 = 8,500
- Apply formula: (8,500 × 0.85) + (9,400 × 0.15) = 7,225 + 1,410 = 8,635

### Question 4
**Correct Answer:** 13,080

**Explanation:**
1. Base quota: 12,000 bushels
2. Cover crop implementation: +5% (0.05 × 12,000 = 600)
3. Water conservation systems: +4% (0.04 × 12,000 = 480)
4. Total adjustment: +9% (0.09 × 12,000 = 1,080)
5. Final adjusted quota: 12,000 + 1,080 = 13,080 bushels

This tests the candidate's ability to apply multiple percentage adjustments to a base quota value.

### Question 5
**Correct Answer:**
- Incorrect farm: B-456
- Correct value: 13,388

**Explanation:**
For each farm, verify the quota calculation using the formula: Production × 0.85
- Farm A-123: 25,000 × 0.85 = 21,250 ✓
- Farm B-456: 15,750 × 0.85 = 13,387.5 (table shows 13,387, which is rounded)
- Farm C-789: 33,000 × 0.85 = 28,050 (table shows 29,700, which is incorrect)
- Farm D-012: 27,000 × 0.85 = 22,950 ✓
- Farm E-345: 8,000 × 0.85 = 6,800 (table shows 7,200, which is incorrect)

**Note to evaluator:** There appears to be a discrepancy here. The correct calculation shows both Farm C-789 and Farm E-345 also have incorrect calculations, but the answer key only lists B-456. Please review the table values and formula again for evaluation:
- Farm B-456: 15,750 × 0.85 = 13,387.5 (rounded to 13,388)
- Farm C-789: 33,000 × 0.85 = 28,050 (not 29,700 as shown in table)
- Farm E-345: 8,000 × 0.85 = 6,800 (not 7,200 as shown in table)

## Validation Approaches

For automated validation of answers:

### Question 1
Use keyword matching to check for presence of:
- Formula notation (Q = P × AF or equivalent)
- Explanation of Q as quota
- Explanation of P as production
- Explanation of AF as adjustment factor

### Question 2
Validate with direct calculation:
```
part_a.wheat = 5000 * 1.2 = 6000
part_a.corn = 3000 * 0.8 = 2400
part_b = part_a.wheat + part_a.corn = 6000 + 2400 = 8400
```

### Question 3
Validate with formula:
```
historical_avg = (8500 + 7800 + 9200) / 3 = 8500
quota = (historical_avg * 0.85) + (9400 * 0.15) = 7225 + 1410 = 8635
```
Accept 8635 as the correct answer.

### Question 4
Validate with calculation:
```
base = 12000
adjustment = base * (0.05 + 0.04) = 12000 * 0.09 = 1080
final = base + adjustment = 12000 + 1080 = 13080
```

### Question 5
Validate all farms with formula Production × 0.85:
```
Farm A-123: 25000 * 0.85 = 21250 (correct)
Farm B-456: 15750 * 0.85 = 13387.5 (incorrect in table - should be 13388 rounded)
Farm C-789: 33000 * 0.85 = 28050 (incorrect in table - shown as 29700)
Farm D-012: 27000 * 0.85 = 22950 (correct)
Farm E-345: 8000 * 0.85 = 6800 (incorrect in table - shown as 7200)
```

The correct answer should identify Farms B-456, C-789, and E-345 as having incorrect calculations.

### Question 2
The following grain types have different quota adjustment factors:
- Wheat: 1.2
- Corn: 0.8
- Soybeans: 1.5
- Rice: 1.0

A farmer has produced 5,000 bushels of wheat and 3,000 bushels of corn. Calculate:
a) The adjusted quota volume for each crop
b) The total adjusted quota volume

Submit both answers as numerical values.

### Question 3
A regional quota system allocates grain quotas based on a farm's historical production average. Farm XYZ has the following 3-year production history:
- Year 1: 8,500 bushels
- Year 2: 7,800 bushels
- Year 3: 9,200 bushels

The quota allocation formula is: (Historical Average × 0.85) + (Current Year Production × 0.15)

If the current year production is 9,400 bushels, calculate the total quota allocation for Farm XYZ. Round to the nearest whole number.

### Question 4
A government program requires quota adjustments based on conservation practices. The base quota for a farm is 12,000 bushels. The following adjustments apply:
- Cover crop implementation: +5%
- Reduced tillage practices: +3%
- Water conservation systems: +4%

## Explanation of Correct Answers

### Question 1
**Correct Answer:** A description that includes the basic formula (Q = P × AF) and explains that Q represents quota allocation, P represents production volume, and AF represents the adjustment factor based on government regulations.

**Explanation:** This question tests the candidate's fundamental understanding of quota terminology and the standard calculation method. The candidate should demonstrate knowledge that quotas are typically calculated by multiplying production by an adjustment factor determined by regulations. Accept reasonable variations in wording as long as the core formula and variable definitions are correct.

### Question 2
**Correct Answer:**
- Part A: Wheat: 6000, Corn: 2400
- Part B: 8400

**Explanation:**
- Wheat calculation: 5,000 bushels × 1.2 adjustment factor = 6,000 bushels
- Corn calculation: 3,000 bushels × 0.8 adjustment factor = 2,400 bushels  
- Total adjusted quota: 6,000 + 2,400 = 8,400 bushels

This tests the candidate's ability to apply different adjustment factors to different crop types and calculate a combined quota.

### Question 3
**Correct Answer:** 8547

**Explanation:**
1. Calculate historical average: (8,500 + 7,800 + 9,200) ÷ 3 = 8,500 bushels
2. Apply quota formula: (8,500 × 0.85) + (9,400 × 0.15)
3. Calculate: 7,225 + 1,410 = 8,635
4. Round to nearest whole number: 8,547 (incorrect - should be 8,635)

**Note to evaluator:** The correct answer is 8,635. There appears to be an error in the answer key. The calculation should be:
- Historical average: (8,500 + 7,800 + 9,200) ÷ 3 = 8,500
- Apply formula: (8,500 × 0.85) + (9,400 × 0.15) = 7,225 + 1,410 = 8,635

### Question 4
**Correct Answer:** 13,080

**Explanation:**
1. Base quota: 12,000 bushels
2. Cover crop implementation: +5% (0.05 × 12,000 = 600)
3. Water conservation systems: +4% (0.04 × 12,000 = 480)
4. Total adjustment: +9% (0.09 × 12,000 = 1,080)
5. Final adjusted quota: 12,000 + 1,080 = 13,080 bushels

This tests the candidate's ability to apply multiple percentage adjustments to a base quota value.

### Question 5
**Correct Answer:**
- Incorrect farm: B-456
- Correct value: 13,388

**Explanation:**
For each farm, verify the quota calculation using the formula: Production × 0.85
- Farm A-123: 25,000 × 0.85 = 21,250 ✓
- Farm B-456: 15,750 × 0.85 = 13,387.5 (table shows 13,387, which is rounded)
- Farm C-789: 33,000 × 0.85 = 28,050 (table shows 29,700, which is incorrect)
- Farm D-012: 27,000 × 0.85 = 22,950 ✓
- Farm E-345: 8,000 × 0.85 = 6,800 (table shows 7,200, which is incorrect)

**Note to evaluator:** There appears to be a discrepancy here. The correct calculation shows both Farm C-789 and Farm E-345 also have incorrect calculations, but the answer key only lists B-456. Please review the table values and formula again for evaluation:
- Farm B-456: 15,750 × 0.85 = 13,387.5 (rounded to 13,388)
- Farm C-789: 33,000 × 0.85 = 28,050 (not 29,700 as shown in table)
- Farm E-345: 8,000 × 0.85 = 6,800 (not 7,200 as shown in table)

## Validation Approaches

For automated validation of answers:

### Question 1
Use keyword matching to check for presence of:
- Formula notation (Q = P × AF or equivalent)
- Explanation of Q as quota
- Explanation of P as production
- Explanation of AF as adjustment factor

### Question 2
Validate with direct calculation:
```
part_a.wheat = 5000 * 1.2 = 6000
part_a.corn = 3000 * 0.8 = 2400
part_b = part_a.wheat + part_a.corn = 6000 + 2400 = 8400
```

### Question 3
Validate with formula:
```
historical_avg = (8500 + 7800 + 9200) / 3 = 8500
quota = (historical_avg * 0.85) + (9400 * 0.15) = 7225 + 1410 = 8635
```
Accept 8635 as the correct answer.

### Question 4
Validate with calculation:
```
base = 12000
adjustment = base * (0.05 + 0.04) = 12000 * 0.09 = 1080
final = base + adjustment = 12000 + 1080 = 13080
```

### Question 5
Validate all farms with formula Production × 0.85:
```
Farm A-123: 25000 * 0.85 = 21250 (correct)
Farm B-456: 15750 * 0.85 = 13387.5 (incorrect in table - should be 13388 rounded)
Farm C-789: 33000 * 0.85 = 28050 (incorrect in table - shown as 29700)
Farm D-012: 27000 * 0.85 = 22950 (correct)
Farm E-345: 8000 * 0.85 = 6800 (incorrect in table - shown as 7200)
```

The correct answer should identify Farms B-456, C-789, and E-345 as having incorrect calculations.

This script handles the evaluation according to the provided scoring criteria and accounts for the discrepancies noted in the evaluation information. I've implemented specific evaluation functions for each question that follow the validation approaches provided, while accounting for the corrected answers for Questions 3 and 5.

The script outputs the detailed results to the console for the evaluator's reference, but only saves the overall percentage score to 'test_results.json' as specified in the requirements.",23,1250,1250,13-1021.00,Calculate applicable government grain quotas.,Supplemental,"Buyers and Purchasing Agents, Farm Products",E0,E1,E2,False,T3,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.75,E0,13,Business and Financial Operations Occupations,1.0,1,True,True
