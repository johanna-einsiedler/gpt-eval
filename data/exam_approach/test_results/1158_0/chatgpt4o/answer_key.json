        "question3": "The increase in Inventory-to-Sales Ratio from 1.34 to 1.42 suggests a buildup of unsold inventory relative to sales. This typically indicates weakening demand or businesses overstocking in anticipation of future shortages or price increases.",
        "question4": [

            ],
            "justification": "Based on the 2023 downward trend (-15.42% from January to September), we can expect continued mild decline. The last three months show stabilization (2188-2223), and fourth quarter data from previous years shows modest rebounds. The predicted range accounts for continuation of the current stabilization pattern with seasonal factors."

            ],
            "rationale": "With critically low industry inventory levels (15-year lows) combined with multiple imminent supply disruption risks (typhoon, port strikes), semiconductor prices will likely increase significantly. The 15-30% range reflects the severity of combined disruptions, with the high-end scenario representing typhoon damage to manufacturing facilities coupled with port strikes."

    "section4": {
        "question1": "The market is in contango, with futures prices rising for the next 3 months then declining for longer-term contracts. This indicates the market expects near-term supply constraints or increased demand, followed by equilibrium returning to the market in the medium to long term.",
        "question2": -11.04,
        "question3": "The declining open interest and volume across contract months indicates decreasing liquidity and market participation in longer-dated contracts. This suggests greater uncertainty about future market conditions and that most traders are focused on near-term price movements rather than taking long-term positions.",
        "question4": "I recommend a layered hedging strategy utilizing futures contracts across different time periods. Purchase 40% of requirements using Month+3 contracts to secure near-term needs, 30% with Month+6 contracts, and 30% with Month+12 contracts to take advantage of the price discount in longer-dated futures. This balances price risk while capitalizing on the market's contango structure, avoiding locking in all purchases at current higher prices."
