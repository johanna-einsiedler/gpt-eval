Supplier Z: Minimum order 10,000 kg. With storage capacity of 15,000 kg, can order 10,000 kg every 2.5 months. Total orders: 3 orders of 10,000 kg = 30,000 kg (excess inventory). Total cost: 24,000 kg × $2.75/kg = $66,000. However, we must account for quality defect rates: Supplier X effective cost: $71,250 ÷ (1 - 0.005) = $71,608.04. Supplier Y effective cost: $75,600 ÷ (1 - 0.002) = $75,751.50. Supplier Z effective cost: $66,000 ÷ (1 - 0.012) = $66,801.62.

A high ratio indicates heavy reliance on debt financing, which may limit future investment capacity and increase vulnerability to interest rate changes or economic downturns. This could affect the supplier's ability to maintain equipment, invest in quality improvements, or expand capacity to meet your future needs."

A consistently positive and stable margin indicates efficient operations and pricing sustainability. Low or declining margins may signal cost control issues, pricing pressures, or inefficient production processes that could eventually lead to quality compromises, delivery problems, or price increases as the supplier attempts to restore profitability."

A supplier with exceptional on-time delivery performance and supply chain resilience justifies premium pricing by eliminating costly production disruptions. For example, if a $10,000/hour production line stops due to missing components, even a 20% price premium from a reliable supplier is justified if it prevents just one hour of downtime per month.
