        "analysis": "The peak in sales during December is likely due to seasonal holiday shopping.

        "economic_conditions": "Current economic conditions are characterized by moderate inflation, although there are signs of easing in some sectors. Consumer confidence remains somewhat cautious due to persistent inflationary pressures on essential goods and services. Employment rates are relatively stable, but real wage growth is lagging behind inflation, impacting disposable income.",
        "predicted_impact": "These economic conditions are likely to lead to more price-sensitive consumer buying patterns in the next quarter. Consumers may prioritize essential purchases and reduce spending on discretionary items. There might be a shift towards value-oriented shopping, with increased demand for budget-friendly alternatives and promotional deals. Retailers may need to focus on competitive pricing and highlight value propositions to maintain sales volumes."
