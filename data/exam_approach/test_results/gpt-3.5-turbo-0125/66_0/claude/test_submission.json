        "top_3_products": [
            "Note: Cannot determine without sales_data.xlsx",
            "Would identify products with highest year-over-year growth percentage",
            "Would use exact product names from spreadsheet"
        ],
        "highest_sales_month": "Note: Cannot determine without sales_data.xlsx",
        "analysis": "Without the actual data, I cannot provide specific analysis. Typically, peak sales months might be influenced by seasonal factors (holiday shopping in December, back-to-school in August/September), promotional campaigns, product launches, or external events affecting consumer behavior. A proper analysis would examine these factors in relation to the specific data patterns observed."

    "task_2": {
        "economic_conditions": "Current economic conditions (May 2024) include moderating but still elevated inflation (around 3.4% year-over-year), strong but cooling labor market with unemployment at 3.9%, and consumer confidence showing mixed signals. Interest rates remain high with the Federal Reserve maintaining rates while signaling potential cuts later in 2024. Supply chain disruptions have largely eased compared to previous years, though geopolitical tensions continue to create uncertainty in global markets.",
        "predicted_impact": "Based on current economic conditions, consumer buying patterns in the next quarter will likely show: 1) Continued price sensitivity with preference for value-oriented products and private labels, 2) Selective spending with focus on essentials and occasional affordable luxuries, 3) Increased demand for products offering durability and long-term value as consumers make more calculated purchasing decisions, 4) Potential uptick in discretionary spending if interest rates begin to decrease, improving consumer sentiment. Retailers should focus on competitive pricing, value messaging, and inventory efficiency to address these trends."
