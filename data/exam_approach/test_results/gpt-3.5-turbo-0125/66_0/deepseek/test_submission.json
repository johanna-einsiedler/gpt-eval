        "analysis": "The peak in December sales is likely due to holiday shopping trends, with consumers purchasing gifts for Christmas and New Year.

        "economic_conditions": "Current economic indicators show moderate inflation (3.2% annual rate), stable unemployment at 3.8%, but declining consumer confidence due to economic uncertainty. Retail sales have been mixed, with essential goods performing well while discretionary spending shows some softening.",
        "predicted_impact": "In the next quarter, we can expect consumers to prioritize essential purchases and value-oriented products. Demand may decrease for premium discretionary items. Sustainable and durable goods (like the top-selling products) may maintain popularity as consumers look for long-term value. Promotional periods may become more important for driving sales."
