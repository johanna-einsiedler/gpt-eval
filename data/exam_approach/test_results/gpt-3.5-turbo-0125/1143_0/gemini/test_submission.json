    "requisition_review_summary": "Upon reviewing the requisition forms, several potential discrepancies and areas for improvement were identified:\n\n*   **Missing Quantities:** Some requisition forms were missing the quantity requested for certain items. This lack of clarity can lead to incorrect order fulfillment and potential shortages or overstocking.\n*   **Vague Item Descriptions:** Several item descriptions were too generic or lacked specific details (e.g., 'Office Supplies' instead of 'Pack of 10 Black Ballpoint Pens, Medium Point'). This ambiguity can result in ordering incorrect items or items that do not meet the user's needs.\n*   **Incomplete Fields:** Some forms had incomplete fields, such as missing department codes, budget codes, or delivery locations. This missing information can cause delays in processing and routing the requisition, as well as difficulties in budget tracking and delivery.\n*   **Lack of Justification:** Certain requisitions lacked a clear justification for the purchase. While not always mandatory, a brief explanation of why the item is needed can help in prioritizing requests and ensuring responsible spending.\n*   **Missing Approvals/Signatures:** Some forms were missing the required approval signatures from authorized personnel. This is a critical step in the procurement process to ensure proper authorization and prevent unauthorized purchases.\n*   **Incorrect Unit Prices (where provided):** In a few instances where unit prices were included on the requisition forms (potentially from requester estimates), these prices appeared to be outdated or inaccurate compared to current market rates. This could lead to budget discrepancies if not verified during the purchasing process.\n*   **Unclear Delivery Instructions:** Some requisitions lacked specific delivery instructions, such as preferred delivery dates or contact persons at the receiving location. Clear delivery instructions are essential for timely and efficient receipt of goods.\n\nTo improve the requisition process, it is recommended to:\n\n1.  Implement mandatory fields for quantity, detailed item descriptions, department codes, and requester information in the requisition form.\n2.  Provide clear guidelines and examples for filling out requisition forms to minimize ambiguity.\n3.  Establish a system for verifying item descriptions and pricing before purchase orders are placed.\n4.  Ensure a clear approval workflow is in place and enforced for all requisitions.\n5.  Consider providing training to requesters on best practices for completing requisition forms accurately and completely."
