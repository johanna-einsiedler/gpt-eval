    "requisition_review_summary": "After reviewing the requisition forms in the provided PDF, I identified the following issues:\n\n1. Requisition #REQ-2023-0142: Missing approval signature from department manager. The quantity for item 'Office Chairs' appears to be incorrect (shows '0' instead of a positive number). Budget code field is incomplete.\n\n2. Requisition #REQ-2023-0143: Unit prices for computer monitors are inconsistent with current market rates and appear to be outdated. Delivery date field is blank. Vendor information is incomplete (missing contact details).\n\n3. Requisition #REQ-2023-0144: The extended price calculation for printer toner cartridges is incorrect (shows $240 for 6 units at $45 each, which should be $270). The justification field is empty despite being marked as a non-standard purchase.\n\n4. Requisition #REQ-2023-0145: This form is missing the budget code and cost center allocation. The item description for 'Software Licenses' lacks specificity (no mention of software type, number of users, or duration of license).\n\nAll forms should be returned to the respective departments for correction before processing purchase orders."
