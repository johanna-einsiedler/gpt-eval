    "task_1": {
        "product_features": "Industrial-grade hydraulic press with 50-ton capacity, featuring dual-action cylinders, digital pressure monitoring system, and programmable operation cycles. Includes emergency stop functionality and overload protection.",
        "quality_standards": "Must comply with ISO 9001:2015 quality management standards, ANSI B11.2 safety requirements for hydraulic power presses, and CE certification for European market compliance. Minimum operational lifespan of 15,000 hours under normal operating conditions.",
        "dimensions": "Working area: 36\" × 24\" (91.4 cm × 61 cm); Overall dimensions: 60\" × 48\" × 84\" (152.4 cm × 121.9 cm × 213.4 cm); Clearance height: 30\" (76.2 cm) adjustable to 40\" (101.6 cm).",
        "materials": "Frame constructed from ASTM A36 structural steel with minimum thickness of 1.5\" (3.8 cm) for main support columns. Hydraulic components using SAE 1045 steel for cylinders with chrome plating for wear resistance. Control panel housing made of 304 stainless steel for corrosion resistance.",
        "additional_information": "Operating pressure range: 500-5000 PSI (34.5-344.7 bar); Power requirements: 480V, 3-phase, 60Hz, 30A; Hydraulic fluid: ISO VG 46 hydraulic oil; Noise level: <80 dB at 1 meter distance; Warranty: 2 years parts and labor with option for extended service plan; Installation requirements: Level concrete floor with minimum 6\" (15.2 cm) thickness and 4000 PSI compressive strength."

    "task_2": [
        {
            "issue": "Incomplete material specifications for electrical components",
            "explanation": "The specification lists materials for the structural components but fails to detail the requirements for electrical wiring, control systems, and circuit protection devices. This omission could lead to substandard electrical components being used, creating potential safety hazards and reliability issues.",
            "suggestion": "Add a dedicated section for electrical component specifications including: required UL/CSA certifications for all electrical components, minimum wire gauge requirements (e.g., 12 AWG for power circuits), specification for PLC controller (e.g., Allen-Bradley CompactLogix with minimum 8 digital inputs and 8 digital outputs), and NEMA rating requirements for all electrical enclosures (minimum NEMA 4 for general industrial environments)."
        },
        {
            "issue": "Ambiguous quality testing procedures",
            "explanation": "The specification mentions quality standards but does not define specific testing procedures or acceptance criteria. Without clear testing protocols, it's difficult to verify if the delivered product meets the required specifications, potentially leading to disputes with suppliers.",
            "suggestion": "Develop a detailed testing and acceptance protocol section that includes: specific load testing requirements (e.g., operation at 125% of rated capacity for 1 hour without failure), cycle testing parameters (minimum 500 continuous cycles without performance degradation), precision/accuracy measurements for the digital monitoring system (±0.5% accuracy), and detailed inspection checklist for visual and functional verification upon delivery."
        },
        {
            "issue": "Missing environmental operating conditions",
            "explanation": "The specification does not define the environmental conditions under which the equipment must operate reliably. Without this information, suppliers might deliver equipment that fails prematurely when exposed to the actual operating environment.",
            "suggestion": "Add an environmental requirements section specifying: operating temperature range (e.g., 32°F to 120°F / 0°C to 49°C), humidity tolerance (e.g., 10-90% non-condensing), dust/particulate exposure rating, chemical resistance requirements if applicable, and altitude limitations if the equipment will be used at high elevations where air pressure differences could affect hydraulic performance."
