        "product_features": "Ergonomic design to promote good posture and comfort during extended periods of sitting. Adjustable seat height, backrest tilt, and armrest height to accommodate various user preferences and body types. Swivel base for easy movement and access to the surrounding workspace. Durable construction suitable for daily office use.",
        "quality_standards": "Must meet ANSI/BIFMA X5.1-2017 standards for general-purpose office chairs, including tests for structural integrity, durability, and safety. All materials should be non-toxic and compliant with relevant environmental regulations (e.g., REACH, RoHS). Foam cushioning should be fire retardant according to CAL 117 or equivalent standards. Fabric should be abrasion-resistant and easy to clean.",
        "dimensions": "Overall Height: Adjustable from 95 cm to 105 cm. Seat Height: Adjustable from 45 cm to 55 cm. Seat Width: 50 cm. Seat Depth: 48 cm. Backrest Height: 55 cm. Backrest Width: 45 cm. Armrest Height: Adjustable from 20 cm to 30 cm above seat. Base Diameter: 65 cm.",
        "materials": "Seat and Backrest Upholstery: High-quality breathable mesh fabric with a minimum Martindale abrasion rating of 50,000 cycles. Cushioning: High-density molded foam with a density of 50 kg/mÂ³. Frame: Steel frame with a powder-coated finish for corrosion resistance. Armrests: Polypropylene with soft polyurethane (PU) padding on top. Base: Five-star nylon base with 60mm diameter dual-wheel casters suitable for carpet and hard floors.",
        "additional_information": "Weight Capacity: Minimum 120 kg. Assembly: Chair should be delivered in a knock-down kit form with clear and easy-to-follow assembly instructions. Warranty: Minimum 2-year warranty against manufacturing defects. Color: Black mesh upholstery with a black frame and base. Packaging: Must be packaged securely to prevent damage during transportation. Packaging should be recyclable."

            "issue": "Missing unit of measurement for seat height adjustment range.",
            "explanation": "The 'Sample_Specification.pdf' states 'Seat Height: Adjustable from 45 to 55'. It is unclear whether this is in centimeters, inches, or another unit. Without a unit, suppliers cannot accurately determine if their product meets this specification, and it can lead to misunderstandings and incorrect product delivery.",
            "suggestion": "Specify the unit of measurement for all dimensions. For example, change 'Seat Height: Adjustable from 45 to 55' to 'Seat Height: Adjustable from 45 cm to 55 cm'."
        },
        {
            "issue": "Vague quality standard regarding material durability.",
            "explanation": "The 'Sample_Specification.pdf' mentions 'durable materials' but does not define specific durability requirements. 'Durable' is subjective and open to interpretation. This lack of clarity can result in receiving products that do not meet the intended lifespan or performance expectations.",
            "suggestion": "Replace vague terms like 'durable materials' with quantifiable quality standards. For example, for fabric durability, specify a minimum Martindale abrasion rating (e.g., 'Upholstery fabric must have a minimum Martindale abrasion rating of 30,000 cycles'). For structural components, specify material strength or testing standards (e.g., 'Steel frame must meet ANSI/BIFMA X5.1 standards for structural integrity')."

        {
            "issue": "Incomplete specification for casters.",
            "explanation": "The 'Sample_Specification.pdf' mentions 'casters' but does not specify the type or material. Different types of casters are suitable for different floor types (carpet, hard floor). Not specifying the caster type can lead to the purchase of chairs with casters unsuitable for the intended office environment, causing damage to flooring or hindering chair mobility.",
            "suggestion": "Specify the type and material of casters required. For example, 'Casters: 60mm diameter dual-wheel casters, suitable for both carpet and hard floors, made of nylon with polyurethane (PU) treads for smooth and quiet rolling and floor protection'."
