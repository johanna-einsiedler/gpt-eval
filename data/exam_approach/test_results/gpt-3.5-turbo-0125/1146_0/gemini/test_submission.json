                "name": "Export Administration Regulations (EAR)",
                "description": "The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) are a set of U.S. regulations that control the export, re-export, and transfer (in-country) of items, commodities, software, and technology considered 'dual-use' â€“ items that have both commercial and military or proliferation applications. These regulations are administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) under the U.S. Department of Commerce.",
                "application": "If the electronic components or the technology used to produce them are of U.S. origin, or if the purchasing company is based in the U.S., the EAR may apply to the transaction even when dealing with an international supplier.  The company needs to determine if the components fall under EAR control and ensure compliance with licensing requirements or exemptions before importing them. This includes verifying the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) of the components and understanding any restrictions based on the supplier's country and the end-use of the components."

                "name": "Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS)",
                "description": "The Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) is a European Union directive that restricts the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (EEE). The directive aims to reduce the risks to human health and the environment posed by these substances. RoHS restricts the use of lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and several other substances in EEE.",
                "application": "When purchasing electronic components from an international supplier, especially if the components or the final products incorporating them are intended for sale or use within the European Union, RoHS compliance is crucial. The company must ensure that the electronic components provided by the international supplier comply with the RoHS directive, meaning they must not contain the restricted substances above the permitted levels. Due diligence is required to obtain compliance documentation from the supplier and potentially conduct testing to verify RoHS compliance."

                "name": "Product Safety Standards - IEC 60950-1 (or relevant IEC standards for electronic components)",
                "description": "IEC 60950-1 is an internationally recognized standard for the safety of information technology equipment, including electrical business equipment and associated equipment. While IEC 60950-1 has been largely replaced by IEC 62368-1, it remains relevant for many existing products and jurisdictions.  More broadly, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) develops and publishes a wide range of international standards for electrical, electronic and related technologies. These standards cover various aspects of product safety, performance, and environmental considerations.",
                "application": "To ensure product safety and meet regulatory requirements in many countries, electronic components must adhere to relevant product safety standards such as those developed by the IEC. For electronic components, this means ensuring they are designed and manufactured to meet safety requirements to prevent hazards like electric shock, fire, and energy hazards.  The purchasing company should request compliance certificates or test reports from the international supplier demonstrating that the components meet applicable IEC standards (or other relevant national or regional safety standards) before incorporating them into their products or using them. This is important for both legal compliance and to ensure the safety of the end products and users."
