        "analysis": "Based on the financial data analysis, I observed a 7% annual increase in raw material costs over the past 3 years, while sales volumes have increased by 12% year-over-year. Market competition has intensified with 3 new entrants, but demand remains strong with a 5% growth projection for the next fiscal year. Seasonal pricing fluctuations show Q4 typically commanding a 10-15% premium over Q2 prices.",
        "pricing_strategy": "I recommend implementing a tiered pricing structure with volume discounts to maintain competitiveness while protecting margins. Specifically, establish a 5% price increase to offset rising material costs, offer 3-7% volume discounts for large orders, implement seasonal pricing adjustments of 5-10% during peak demand periods, and establish long-term contracts with key customers that include price escalation clauses tied to material cost indices."
