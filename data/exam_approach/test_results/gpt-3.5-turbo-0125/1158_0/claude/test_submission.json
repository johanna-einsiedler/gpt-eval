        "graph_image": "price_trend_graph.png",
        "analysis": "Unable to complete this task as the commodity_price_data.xlsx file was not provided. With the actual data, I would import it into a spreadsheet application, create a line graph showing price trends over the past year, and analyze patterns such as seasonality, volatility periods, and overall directional movement. I would identify potential factors influencing these trends, such as supply chain disruptions, regulatory changes, seasonal demand fluctuations, or macroeconomic factors affecting the specific commodity market."

            "https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/commodities",

        "report": "Without knowing the specific commodity from the dataset, I cannot provide a targeted market analysis. In a complete response, I would research the current market conditions for the commodity using reputable sources like Bloomberg, S&P Global, industry-specific publications, and government economic data. My report would include recent price movements, supply and demand dynamics, relevant geopolitical factors, regulatory changes, and industry-specific news affecting the commodity. I would analyze how current conditions compare to the historical data from Task 1, identifying emerging trends and potential future price movements that could impact purchasing decisions."
