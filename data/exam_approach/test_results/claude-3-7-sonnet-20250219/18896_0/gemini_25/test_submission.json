        {
            "risk_id": 1,
            "risk_description": "Risk of strike or work stoppage due to significant gap between company's initial wage/healthcare offer and union demands, exacerbated by recent ULP, competitor settlements, and aggressive union representation.",
            "probability": 4,
            "impact": 5,
            "risk_score": 20,
            "risk_category": "Operational",
            "justification": "The wide gap on core economic issues, combined with recent tensions (ULP, new rep) and critical Q4 timing, makes a work stoppage highly probable. Impact is severe due to potential disruption of production and customer deliveries."
        },
        {
            "risk_id": 2,
            "risk_description": "Failure to reach agreement on healthcare cost containment, leading to unsustainable cost increases or bargaining impasse. Union demands increased company share and new dental, while company seeks status quo plus HDHP.",
            "probability": 4,
            "impact": 4,
            "risk_score": 16,
            "risk_category": "Financial",
            "justification": "Healthcare costs are rising rapidly (8% annually) and positions are far apart. Failure to manage these costs significantly impacts the company's below-average profitability, making this a highly probable and major financial risk."

        {
            "risk_id": 3,
            "risk_description": "Further decline in employee morale leading to decreased productivity and worsening quality issues. Caused by low wage offer, proposed changes to layoff security, ignoring PTO demands, and existing low satisfaction.",
            "probability": 4,
            "impact": 3,
            "risk_score": 12,
            "risk_category": "Operational",
            "justification": "The company's initial hard stance on key employee concerns, coupled with existing low morale (65% satisfaction) and quality problems (up 15%), makes further decline highly probable, moderately impacting operational efficiency and output quality."
        },
        {
            "risk_id": 4,
            "risk_description": "Inability to implement desired operational flexibility regarding layoff procedures (skills/performance vs. seniority) and use of temporary workers due to strong union opposition.",
            "probability": 4,
            "impact": 3,
            "risk_score": 12,
            "risk_category": "Operational",
            "justification": "Union demands explicitly contradict company goals for flexibility (stronger job security, temp restrictions). Given union traditions and specific demands, achieving desired flexibility faces high probability of resistance, moderately impacting adaptability."

            "impact": 3,
            "risk_score": 9,
            "risk_category": "Legal",
            "justification": "A ULP is already filed, the union has an aggressive rep, and proposed changes challenge established practices. This creates a moderate likelihood of further legal action, incurring costs and diverting management focus."

            "risk_id": 6,

            "impact": 3,
            "risk_score": 9,
            "risk_category": "Reputational",
            "justification": "A difficult negotiation, especially if resulting in a strike or public disputes over wages/safety (given media attention), could moderately harm the company's image as a major local employer and affect talent attraction."

Link movement on wages/healthcare to union agreement on operational priorities like HDHP option or modified temp worker language. Simultaneously, prepare comprehensive strike contingency plans, including inventory management, security, and communication protocols for stakeholders.",
            "expected_outcome": "Increases the probability of reaching a settlement without a work stoppage by showing flexibility on key economic issues. Minimizes operational and financial disruption during critical Q4 if a strike does occur through proactive planning."

            "risk_id": 2,
            "mitigation_strategy": "Propose forming a joint labor-management committee dedicated to exploring healthcare cost-saving measures (e.g., wellness initiatives, plan design alternatives, consumer education) during the contract. Offer a modest concession, such as funding a feasibility study for dental coverage or a slight increase in premium share, contingent on union acceptance of the HDHP option to provide choice and potential savings.",
            "expected_outcome": "Creates a collaborative approach to cost control, potentially identifying mutually agreeable solutions. Achieves some cost containment/predictability through the HDHP option while addressing union interest in healthcare improvements, reducing likelihood of impasse on this single issue."

            "risk_id": 3,
            "mitigation_strategy": "Demonstrate willingness to compromise on lower-cost or non-economic union priorities, such as agreeing to the enhanced safety committee structure or a modest improvement in PTO for long-service employees. Clearly communicate the business rationale for layoff flexibility (lost customer, market changes), potentially linking it to retraining commitments. Re-evaluate the initial 1.5% wage offer to be more competitive.",
            "expected_outcome": "Improves the bargaining atmosphere and signals that the company values employee concerns beyond pure economics. Helps stabilize morale, potentially halting the decline in productivity and quality by addressing key irritants and fostering better communication."
