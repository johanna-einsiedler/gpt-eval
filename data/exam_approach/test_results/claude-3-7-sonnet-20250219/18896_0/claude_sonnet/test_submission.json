Schedule early informal discussions with union leadership before formal negotiations to build rapport.",

Early relationship-building with union leadership establishes good faith and identifies potential compromise areas before positions harden in formal negotiations."

Develop tiered proposal that offers enhanced benefits in non-wage areas (like dental coverage) while maintaining wage discipline. Create financial models showing how productivity improvements could fund wage increases, creating aligned incentives for operational efficiency.",

Propose joint labor-management committee to establish transparent criteria for temporary worker utilization with union oversight. Provide training opportunities for senior employees to develop skills needed for evolving production requirements.",

Joint committee approach demonstrates respect for union role while creating structured process for necessary staffing adjustments."
