Develop creative alternative economic package that addresses union priorities through phased implementation, one-time bonuses instead of base wage increases, and cost-sharing approaches to healthcare that maintain total compensation while controlling fixed costs.",

Alternative package structure allows union to achieve some priority gains while giving company needed financial flexibility and time to recover from lost customer revenue."

Include no-strike/no-lockout provisions and potential retroactive application of economic terms. Simultaneously, develop customer communication plan and identify critical production that could be advanced ahead of potential disruption.",

Customers remain insulated from potential disruption, preserving relationships, while allowing more time to bridge significant gaps in bargaining positions."
