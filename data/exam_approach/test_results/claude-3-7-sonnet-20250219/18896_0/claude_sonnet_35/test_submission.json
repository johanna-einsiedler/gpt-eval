Couple this with a one-time bonus tied to Q4 performance to address immediate concerns.",

Maintain current 80/20 premium split for a base plan, offer a 90/10 split for a high-deductible plan with company HSA contributions, and provide an option for employees to 'buy up' to a premium plan with additional coverage. Implement wellness programs and preventive care incentives to manage long-term costs.",

Develop a point-based system where employees earn points for years of service, specialized skills, and performance ratings. In the event of layoffs, those with the lowest points would be affected first. Include a robust training program to help employees increase their skills and point totals.",
