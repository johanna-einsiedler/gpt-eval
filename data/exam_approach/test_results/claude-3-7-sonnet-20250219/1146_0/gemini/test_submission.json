The scenario states market research found at least five capable small businesses, making a total small business set-aside appropriate and compliant."

As two potential suppliers are proposed for debarment, the purchasing agent must verify their debarment status and exclude them from consideration unless a compelling reason is documented and approved by the agency head."

Since the scenario mentions a sustainability initiative and the computers/printers should be ENERGY STAR certified, this provision is directly applicable. The purchasing agent must ensure the selected equipment meets energy efficiency standards like ENERGY STAR as part of the procurement."
