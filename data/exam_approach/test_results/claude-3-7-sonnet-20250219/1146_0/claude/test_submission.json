According to FAR 9.405, contractors proposed for debarment are excluded from receiving contracts, and agencies shall not solicit offers from or award contracts to these suppliers unless there is a compelling reason determined by the agency head."

Given that market research indicates at least five small businesses can provide the equipment at competitive prices, this procurement should be set aside exclusively for small businesses. This addresses the agency's previous citation for non-compliance with small business utilization requirements."

FAR 23.103 mandates that 95% of new contract actions require products to be energy-efficient. The scenario specifically notes that computers and printers should be ENERGY STAR certified, which aligns with the ENERGY STAR designation requirement in this FAR provision."
