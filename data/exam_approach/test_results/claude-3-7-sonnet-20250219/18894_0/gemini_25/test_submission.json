Resolution involved scheduling them early in Week 2 (GR-044 on Mon 11/13 09:00-11:00, GR-048 on Tue 11/14 09:00-11:00) in Conference Room A.

Case GR-042 (5 participants) was scheduled into an available afternoon slot in Conf A (Wed 11/8 13:00-14:30). Other cases with fewer participants or not requiring privacy were assigned to Conference Room B or Meeting Room C based on availability and capacity (e.g., GR-046 in C, GR-043 in B).",

Initial attempts to schedule GR-044 within Week 1 failed partly due to C. Lee's unavailability on 11/10. The case was successfully scheduled for Monday, November 13th from 09:00 to 11:00 in Conference Room A, a date and time when C. Lee and all other required participants were available, thereby accommodating this key witness's constraints."
