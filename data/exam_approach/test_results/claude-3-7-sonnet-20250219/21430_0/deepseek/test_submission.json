The claimant failed to file a police report despite significant damage ($12,450), and the damage photos show front-end damage inconsistent with a simple backing into a pillar. The repair estimate seems excessive for the described accident.",

            "justification": "This claim warrants investigation due to the delayed reporting (7 days) and a prior water damage claim within the past year.

The high claim amount ($45,800) and pattern of water damage claims raise concerns about property maintenance practices.",

Despite minimal vehicle damage from a low-speed impact, the third-party claimant is seeking extensive treatment ($28,750) that began with an attorney referral. The claimant has a history of similar claims, and the medical treatment appears excessive for the described accident. The immediate attorney involvement is particularly concerning.",

The accident occurred just 14 days after policy inception, and the vehicle was purchased only one month prior. The claimant's financial situation (90 days past due on auto loan) raises concerns about possible financial motive. The significant damage ($22,300) to a recently purchased vehicle warrants closer examination.",

All five occupants are claiming identical injuries from a minor collision, with treatment beginning simultaneously 3 days post-accident. Two passengers have histories of similar claims.
