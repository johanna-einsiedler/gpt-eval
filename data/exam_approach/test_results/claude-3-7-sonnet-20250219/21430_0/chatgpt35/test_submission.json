            ],
            "justification": "This claim warrants investigation due to multiple red flags. The accident occurred just 13 days after policy inception, which is suspicious timing. Additionally, the claimant failed to file a police report despite significant damage ($12,450). The lack of witnesses and the parking lot location make verification difficult. These factors combined suggest potential fraud that requires further investigation.",

            "justification": "While there are some potential red flags including delayed reporting and a prior water damage claim within the past year, the circumstances appear reasonable. The plumber's report confirms legitimate pipe failure, and the claimant's explanation for delayed reporting (dealing with emergency mitigation) is reasonable. The documentation appears consistent and complete.",

Additionally, the third-party claimant has a history of similar claims, which raises suspicion of potential fraud. These factors necessitate further investigation.",
