        "complaint_summary": "Alex Morgan, an IT department employee at Federal Agency XYZ, filed an equal opportunity complaint on March 15, 2023, alleging discrimination based on family status. Morgan, a single parent, claims Department Manager Sam Wilson denied a promotion to Senior Systems Administrator due to family responsibilities. According to Morgan, Wilson explicitly stated concerns about Morgan's ability to handle travel requirements given their 'family situation.' Morgan also alleges a pattern of discrimination, citing performance review comments about 'availability constraints' related to childcare emergencies and exclusion from a conference where Wilson stated a preference for 'someone without family commitments.' The selected candidate, Robert Johnson, has no children and less tenure at the agency. Morgan's complaint is supported by witness statements, performance review documentation, email evidence, and department travel records showing employees with children received fewer travel opportunities.",

Morgan claims Wilson explicitly mentioned family situation as a factor in the non-selection decision, stating 'With your family situation, I wasn't sure you could handle the travel requirements.' Morgan further alleges a pattern of discrimination including negative performance review comments about 'availability constraints' related to childcare responsibilities and exclusion from professional development opportunities based on family commitments.",

        "findings_summary": "The investigation revealed evidence supporting Morgan's allegation of family status discrimination. Multiple witnesses confirmed that Wilson made statements connecting family responsibilities to professional opportunities. Department travel records show a pattern where employees with children received fewer travel assignments. Documentary evidence includes Wilson's email explicitly mentioning Johnson's lack of availability constraints as a factor in selection and Morgan's performance review noting 'availability constraints' related to childcare. While the selected candidate (Johnson) did have some superior qualifications including a higher technical assessment score (92 vs. 88) and more relevant cloud experience for upcoming projects, evidence suggests family status was also a factor in the decision-making process. Wilson denied discriminating but acknowledged discussing travel requirements and possibly asking if travel would be 'manageable given personal circumstances.' Agency policies explicitly prohibit discrimination based on family status and promote work-life balance.",
