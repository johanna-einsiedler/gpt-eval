She values detail, is concerned about trust ('being taken advantage of'), and wants her specific wishes met while managing costs. This strategy focuses on understanding her needs, transparently explaining value and pricing, addressing her concerns directly (like flexibility and prepayment security), and involving her daughter as requested. This builds trust and ensures the final arrangement respects her priorities and budget concerns, aligning with her communication style and decision-making factors."
