This ambiguity could delay reporting of serious safety events and compromise patient safety."

The Synopsis defines the population as having 'SBP ≥ 160 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 100 mmHg' which could lead to enrollment of ineligible patients and compromise study validity."

        "key_issues_summary": "Our review of Protocol XYZ123 has identified three critical issues that require immediate attention before study initiation. First, the adverse event reporting section lacks clarity on when the 24-hour reporting clock for SAEs begins, which could delay safety reporting and compromise patient protection. Second, there is an inconsistency between the Synopsis and Section 5.1 regarding hypertension criteria for enrollment, potentially leading to inclusion of ineligible patients. Third, the informed consent section fails to specify that participants can withdraw at any time without penalty, which violates regulatory requirements. These issues pose significant risks to patient safety, data integrity, and regulatory compliance.",
