Here is brief explanation of the exam's purpose and structure intended for the evaluator: <examoverview> None </examoverview>

### Your assignment:

Based on the explanation write clear, concise instructions for the candidate including:
- What they need to accomplish (without prescribing specific methods)
- Brief description of any materials that will be provided
- Expected format for answer submission
- The actual test they need perform, i.e. the tasks that need to be done or questions that need to be answered.

IMPORTANT: When designing the test, eliminate any opportunities for candidates to make arbitrary choices (like custom account codes, naming conventions, or classification systems) that would complicate evaluation. Either:
- Provide pre-defined structures/codes that must be used, or
- Design questions with objectively verifiable numerical/text answers that don't depend on the candidate's approach. 
- You can ask for text answers that can be compared to an exact match, but avoid asking for text answers such as justification that require interpretation and/or with many possible correct answers.

<MATERIALS_EXPLANATION_FOR_EVALUATOR>
## Materials Explanation

### Overview
The materials are designed to test a candidate's ability to accurately calculate commissions, identify payment discrepancies, apply contract terms, allocate payments, and verify payment method compliance. All materials have been created with clear, unambiguous answers that can be objectively evaluated.

### Spreadsheet Design
The spreadsheet contains three interconnected sheets that provide all necessary information for the tasks:
- Client contract details with specific commission structures
- Income records showing earnings that require commission calculations
- Payment history showing what has actually been paid

### Expected Answers and Calculations

#### Task 1: Calculate Commission Amounts
- Client A: Total gross income = $45,000 + $75,000 = $120,000
  - Commission rate: 10%
  - Commission amount: $120,000 × 10% = $12,000
- Client B: Total gross income = $120,000 + $85,000 = $205,000
  - Commission rate: 15% on first $100,000 = $15,000
  - Commission rate: 12% on remaining $105,000 = $12,600
  - Total commission: $15,000 + $12,600 = $27,600
- Client C: 
  - Concert Tour: $65,000 × 12% = $7,800
  - Merchandise: $32,000 × 8% = $2,560
  - Total commission: $7,800 + $2,560 = $10,360

#### Task 2: Payment Discrepancies
- Client A: Should have paid $12,000, actually paid $4,500 + $7,000 = $11,500
  - Discrepancy: $12,000 - $11,500 = $500 underpaid
- Client B: Should have paid $27,600, actually paid $17,500 + $10,000 = $27,500
  - Discrepancy: $27,600 - $27,500 = $100 underpaid
- Client C: Should have paid $10,360, actually paid $7,500 + $2,000 = $9,500
  - Discrepancy: $10,360 - $9,500 = $860 underpaid
- Underpaid clients: A, B, and C (all clients)

#### Task 3: Apply Contract Payment Terms
- Client A: 
  - Email indicates payment received on June 5th
  - Due date: June 5th + 15 days = June 20th, 2023
  - Late fee: None for film role (payment made before due date)
  - For TV Commercial: Payment due May 1st (April 15th + 15 days), paid May 5th
  - Late fee: $4,500 × 1.5% × (4/30) = $9.00 (4 days late)
- Client B:
  - Email indicates tournament prize money received on June 7th
  - Due date: June 7th + 30 days = July 7th, 2023
  - Late fee: $10,000 payment made on July 15th (8 days late)
  - Late fee calculation: $10,200 × 2% × (8/30) = $54.40
  - Plus existing late fee mentioned in email: $350
- Client C:
  - Email indicates merchandise payment received on June 20th
  - Due date: June 20th + 45 days = August 4th, 2023
  - No late fees for current payments (still within payment window)

#### Task 4: Process Payment Allocation (Client B)
- Recent payment from Client B: $10,000
- Allocation according to contract:
  - Late fees: $350 (from email)
  - Current commission on tournament prize: $85,000 × (15% for first $100K) = $10,200
  - Allocation:
    - To late fees: $350
    - To current commission: $9,650
    - To previous commission: $0
    - Remaining balance owed: $10,200 - $9,650 = $550

#### Task 5: Verify Payment Method Compliance
- Client A: Contract requires direct deposit, but email indicates a check was sent for the film role
  - Compliance: False
- Client B: Contract requires wire transfer, payment history shows wire transfers used
  - Compliance: True
- Client C: Contract allows check or PayPal, payment history shows PayPal used
  - Compliance: True

### Potential Pitfalls for Candidates
1. Client B's tiered commission structure requires careful calculation
2. Client C's different commission rates for different income types
3. The payment application order differs for Client C compared to Clients A and B
4. Late fee calculations require attention to the daily proration mentioned in contracts
5. Email content contains important information about payment receipt dates that affects due dates

All materials are designed to work together cohesively, requiring candidates to cross-reference information between the spreadsheet, PDF contracts, and emails to arrive at the correct answers.

<MATERIALS_EXPLANATION_FOR_EVALUATOR>
## Materials Explanation

### Overview
The materials are designed to test a candidate's ability to accurately calculate commissions, identify payment discrepancies, apply contract terms, allocate payments, and verify payment method compliance. All materials have been created with clear, unambiguous answers that can be objectively evaluated.

### Spreadsheet Design
The spreadsheet contains three interconnected sheets that provide all necessary information for the tasks:
- Client contract details with specific commission structures
- Income records showing earnings that require commission calculations
- Payment history showing what has actually been paid

### Expected Answers and Calculations

#### Task 1: Calculate Commission Amounts
- Client A: Total gross income = $45,000 + $75,000 = $120,000
  - Commission rate: 10%
  - Commission amount: $120,000 × 10% = $12,000
- Client B: Total gross income = $120,000 + $85,000 = $205,000
  - Commission rate: 15% on first $100,000 = $15,000
  - Commission rate: 12% on remaining $105,000 = $12,600
  - Total commission: $15,000 + $12,600 = $27,600
- Client C: 
  - Concert Tour: $65,000 × 12% = $7,800
  - Merchandise: $32,000 × 8% = $2,560
  - Total commission: $7,800 + $2,560 = $10,360

#### Task 2: Payment Discrepancies
- Client A: Should have paid $12,000, actually paid $4,500 + $7,000 = $11,500
  - Discrepancy: $12,000 - $11,500 = $500 underpaid
- Client B: Should have paid $27,600, actually paid $17,500 + $10,000 = $27,500
  - Discrepancy: $27,600 - $27,500 = $100 underpaid
- Client C: Should have paid $10,360, actually paid $7,500 + $2,000 = $9,500
  - Discrepancy: $10,360 - $9,500 = $860 underpaid
- Underpaid clients: A, B, and C (all clients)

#### Task 3: Apply Contract Payment Terms
- Client A: 
  - Email indicates payment received on June 5th
  - Due date: June 5th + 15 days = June 20th, 2023
  - Late fee: None for film role (payment made before due date)
  - For TV Commercial: Payment due May 1st (April 15th + 15 days), paid May 5th
  - Late fee: $4,500 × 1.5% × (4/30) = $9.00 (4 days late)
- Client B:
  - Email indicates tournament prize money received on June 7th
  - Due date: June 7th + 30 days = July 7th, 2023
  - Late fee: $10,000 payment made on July 15th (8 days late)
  - Late fee calculation: $10,200 × 2% × (8/30) = $54.40
  - Plus existing late fee mentioned in email: $350
- Client C:
  - Email indicates merchandise payment received on June 20th
  - Due date: June 20th + 45 days = August 4th, 2023
  - No late fees for current payments (still within payment window)

#### Task 4: Process Payment Allocation (Client B)
- Recent payment from Client B: $10,000
- Allocation according to contract:
  - Late fees: $350 (from email)
  - Current commission on tournament prize: $85,000 × (15% for first $100K) = $10,200
  - Allocation:
    - To late fees: $350
    - To current commission: $9,650
    - To previous commission: $0
    - Remaining balance owed: $10,200 - $9,650 = $550

#### Task 5: Verify Payment Method Compliance
- Client A: Contract requires direct deposit, but email indicates a check was sent for the film role
  - Compliance: False
- Client B: Contract requires wire transfer, payment history shows wire transfers used
  - Compliance: True
- Client C: Contract allows check or PayPal, payment history shows PayPal used
  - Compliance: True

### Potential Pitfalls for Candidates
1. Client B's tiered commission structure requires careful calculation
2. Client C's different commission rates for different income types
3. The payment application order differs for Client C compared to Clients A and B
4. Late fee calculations require attention to the daily proration mentioned in contracts
5. Email content contains important information about payment receipt dates that affects due dates

All materials are designed to work together cohesively, requiring candidates to cross-reference information between the spreadsheet, PDF contracts, and emails to arrive at the correct answers.

## Materials Explanation

### Overview
The materials are designed to test a candidate's ability to accurately calculate commissions, identify payment discrepancies, apply contract terms, allocate payments, and verify payment method compliance. All materials have been created with clear, unambiguous answers that can be objectively evaluated.

### Spreadsheet Design
The spreadsheet contains three interconnected sheets that provide all necessary information for the tasks:
- Client contract details with specific commission structures
- Income records showing earnings that require commission calculations
- Payment history showing what has actually been paid

### Expected Answers and Calculations

#### Task 1: Calculate Commission Amounts
- Client A: Total gross income = $45,000 + $75,000 = $120,000
  - Commission rate: 10%
  - Commission amount: $120,000 × 10% = $12,000
- Client B: Total gross income = $120,000 + $85,000 = $205,000
  - Commission rate: 15% on first $100,000 = $15,000
  - Commission rate: 12% on remaining $105,000 = $12,600
  - Total commission: $15,000 + $12,600 = $27,600
- Client C: 
  - Concert Tour: $65,000 × 12% = $7,800
  - Merchandise: $32,000 × 8% = $2,560
  - Total commission: $7,800 + $2,560 = $10,360

#### Task 2: Payment Discrepancies
- Client A: Should have paid $12,000, actually paid $4,500 + $7,000 = $11,500
  - Discrepancy: $12,000 - $11,500 = $500 underpaid
- Client B: Should have paid $27,600, actually paid $17,500 + $10,000 = $27,500
  - Discrepancy: $27,600 - $27,500 = $100 underpaid
- Client C: Should have paid $10,360, actually paid $7,500 + $2,000 = $9,500
  - Discrepancy: $10,360 - $9,500 = $860 underpaid
- Underpaid clients: A, B, and C (all clients)

#### Task 3: Apply Contract Payment Terms
- Client A: 
  - Email indicates payment received on June 5th
  - Due date: June 5th + 15 days = June 20th, 2023
  - Late fee: None for film role (payment made before due date)
  - For TV Commercial: Payment due May 1st (April 15th + 15 days), paid May 5th
  - Late fee: $4,500 × 1.5% × (4/30) = $9.00 (4 days late)
- Client B:
  - Email indicates tournament prize money received on June 7th
  - Due date: June 7th + 30 days = July 7th, 2023
  - Late fee: $10,000 payment made on July 15th (8 days late)
  - Late fee calculation: $10,200 × 2% × (8/30) = $54.40
  - Plus existing late fee mentioned in email: $350
- Client C:
  - Email indicates merchandise payment received on June 20th
  - Due date: June 20th + 45 days = August 4th, 2023
  - No late fees for current payments (still within payment window)

#### Task 4: Process Payment Allocation (Client B)
- Recent payment from Client B: $10,000
- Allocation according to contract:
  - Late fees: $350 (from email)
  - Current commission on tournament prize: $85,000 × (15% for first $100K) = $10,200
  - Allocation:
    - To late fees: $350
    - To current commission: $9,650
    - To previous commission: $0
    - Remaining balance owed: $10,200 - $9,650 = $550

#### Task 5: Verify Payment Method Compliance
- Client A: Contract requires direct deposit, but email indicates a check was sent for the film role
  - Compliance: False
- Client B: Contract requires wire transfer, payment history shows wire transfers used
  - Compliance: True

## Explanation of Correct Answers

### Task 1: Calculate Commission Amounts

**Client A:**
- Total gross income: $45,000 (TV Commercial) + $75,000 (Film Role) = $120,000
- Commission rate: 10% (standard contract)
- Commission amount: $120,000 × 10% = $12,000.00

**Client B:**
- Total gross income: $120,000 (Sponsorship) + $85,000 (Tournament) = $205,000
- Tiered commission structure:
  - 15% on first $100,000 = $15,000
  - 12% on remaining $105,000 = $12,600
- Total commission: $15,000 + $12,600 = $27,600.00

**Client C:**
- Concert Tour (performance): $65,000 × 12% = $7,800
- Merchandise Sales: $32,000 × 8% = $2,560
- Total commission: $7,800 + $2,560 = $10,360.00

### Task 2: Payment Discrepancies

**Client A:**
- Total commission due: $12,000.00
- Payments received: $4,500.00 + $7,000.00 = $11,500.00
- Discrepancy: $12,000.00 - $11,500.00 = $500.00 (underpaid)

**Client B:**
- Total commission due: $27,600.00
- Payments received: $17,500.00 + $10,000.00 = $27,500.00
- Discrepancy: $27,600.00 - $27,500.00 = $100.00 (underpaid)

**Client C:**
- Total commission due: $10,360.00
- Payments received: $7,500.00 + $2,000.00 = $9,500.00
- Discrepancy: $10,360.00 - $9,500.00 = $860.00 (underpaid)

**Underpaid clients:** All clients (A, B, and C) have underpaid their commissions.

### Task 3: Apply Contract Payment Terms

**Client A:**
- Film Role payment received by client on June 5th (from email)
- Due date: June 5th + 15 days = June 20, 2023
- TV Commercial payment: Received by client April 15th, due April 30th (15 days later)
- Paid on May 5th (5 days late)
- Late fee: $4,500 × 1.5% × (5/30) = $9.00 (prorated for 5 days)

**Client B:**
- Tournament Prize payment received by client on June 7th (from email)
- Due date: June 7th + 30 days = July 7, 2023
- Payment made on July 15th (8 days late)
- New late fee: $10,200 × 2% × (8/30) = $54.40
- Plus existing late fee mentioned in email: $350.00
- Total late fee: $350.00 + $54.40 = $404.40

**Client C:**
- Merchandise Sales payment received by client on June 20th (from email)
- Due date: June 20th + 45 days = August 4, 2023
- No late fees (payment not yet due at time of exam)
- Late fee: $0.00

### Task 4: Process Payment Allocation (Client B)

- Recent payment from Client B: $10,000.00
- Outstanding late fee (from email): $350.00
- Commission due for Tournament Prize: $85,000 × 15% = $10,200.00 (since this falls within the first $100K for the quarter)
- Payment application order per contract: (1) Late fees, (2) Current commissions, (3) Past due amounts
- Allocation:
  - To late fees: $350.00
  - To current commission: $10,000.00 - $350.00 = $9,650.00
  - To previous commission: $0.00 (current commission not fully paid)
  - Remaining balance owed: $10,200.00 - $9,650.00 = $550.00

### Task 5: Verify Payment Method Compliance

**Client A:**
- Contract requires direct deposit only
- Email indicates a check was sent for the Film Role commission
- Compliance: **false** (non-compliant)

**Client B:**
- Contract requires wire transfer only
- Payment history shows wire transfers used for both payments
- Compliance: **true** (compliant)

**Client C:**
- Contract allows check or PayPal
- Payment history shows PayPal used for both payments
- Compliance: **true** (compliant)

<MATERIALS_EXPLANATION_FOR_EVALUATOR>
## Materials Explanation

### Overview
The materials are designed to test a candidate's ability to accurately calculate commissions, identify payment discrepancies, apply contract terms, allocate payments, and verify payment method compliance. All materials have been created with clear, unambiguous answers that can be objectively evaluated.

### Spreadsheet Design
The spreadsheet contains three interconnected sheets that provide all necessary information for the tasks:
- Client contract details with specific commission structures
- Income records showing earnings that require commission calculations
- Payment history showing what has actually been paid

### Expected Answers and Calculations

#### Task 1: Calculate Commission Amounts
- Client A: Total gross income = $45,000 + $75,000 = $120,000
  - Commission rate: 10%
  - Commission amount: $120,000 × 10% = $12,000
- Client B: Total gross income = $120,000 + $85,000 = $205,000
  - Commission rate: 15% on first $100,000 = $15,000
  - Commission rate: 12% on remaining $105,000 = $12,600
  - Total commission: $15,000 + $12,600 = $27,600
- Client C: 
  - Concert Tour: $65,000 × 12% = $7,800
  - Merchandise: $32,000 × 8% = $2,560
  - Total commission: $7,800 + $2,560 = $10,360

#### Task 2: Payment Discrepancies
- Client A: Should have paid $12,000, actually paid $4,500 + $7,000 = $11,500
  - Discrepancy: $12,000 - $11,500 = $500 underpaid
- Client B: Should have paid $27,600, actually paid $17,500 + $10,000 = $27,500
  - Discrepancy: $27,600 - $27,500 = $100 underpaid
- Client C: Should have paid $10,360, actually paid $7,500 + $2,000 = $9,500
  - Discrepancy: $10,360 - $9,500 = $860 underpaid
- Underpaid clients: A, B, and C (all clients)

#### Task 3: Apply Contract Payment Terms
- Client A: 
  - Email indicates payment received on June 5th
  - Due date: June 5th + 15 days = June 20th, 2023
  - Late fee: None for film role (payment made before due date)
  - For TV Commercial: Payment due May 1st (April 15th + 15 days), paid May 5th
  - Late fee: $4,500 × 1.5% × (4/30) = $9.00 (4 days late)
- Client B:
  - Email indicates tournament prize money received on June 7th
  - Due date: June 7th + 30 days = July 7th, 2023
  - Late fee: $10,000 payment made on July 15th (8 days late)
  - Late fee calculation: $10,200 × 2% × (8/30) = $54.40
  - Plus existing late fee mentioned in email: $350
- Client C:
  - Email indicates merchandise payment received on June 20th
  - Due date: June 20th + 45 days = August 4th, 2023
  - No late fees for current payments (still within payment window)

#### Task 4: Process Payment Allocation (Client B)
- Recent payment from Client B: $10,000
- Allocation according to contract:
  - Late fees: $350 (from email)
  - Current commission on tournament prize: $85,000 × (15% for first $100K) = $10,200
  - Allocation:
    - To late fees: $350
    - To current commission: $9,650
    - To previous commission: $0
    - Remaining balance owed: $10,200 - $9,650 = $550

#### Task 5: Verify Payment Method Compliance
- Client A: Contract requires direct deposit, but email indicates a check was sent for the film role
  - Compliance: False
- Client B: Contract requires wire transfer, payment history shows wire transfers used
  - Compliance: True
- Client C: Contract allows check or PayPal, payment history shows PayPal used
  - Compliance: True

### Potential Pitfalls for Candidates
1. Client B's tiered commission structure requires careful calculation
2. Client C's different commission rates for different income types
3. The payment application order differs for Client C compared to Clients A and B
4. Late fee calculations require attention to the daily proration mentioned in contracts
5. Email content contains important information about payment receipt dates that affects due dates

All materials are designed to work together cohesively, requiring candidates to cross-reference information between the spreadsheet, PDF contracts, and emails to arrive at the correct answers.

## Explanation of Correct Answers

### Task 1: Calculate Commission Amounts

**Client A:**
- Total gross income: $45,000 (TV Commercial) + $75,000 (Film Role) = $120,000
- Commission rate: 10% (standard contract)
- Commission amount: $120,000 × 10% = $12,000.00

**Client B:**
- Total gross income: $120,000 (Sponsorship) + $85,000 (Tournament) = $205,000
- Tiered commission structure:
  - 15% on first $100,000 = $15,000
  - 12% on remaining $105,000 = $12,600
- Total commission: $15,000 + $12,600 = $27,600.00

**Client C:**
- Concert Tour (performance): $65,000 × 12% = $7,800
- Merchandise Sales: $32,000 × 8% = $2,560
- Total commission: $7,800 + $2,560 = $10,360.00

### Task 2: Payment Discrepancies

**Client A:**
- Total commission due: $12,000.00
- Payments received: $4,500.00 + $7,000.00 = $11,500.00
- Discrepancy: $12,000.00 - $11,500.00 = $500.00 (underpaid)

**Client B:**
- Total commission due: $27,600.00
- Payments received: $17,500.00 + $10,000.00 = $27,500.00
- Discrepancy: $27,600.00 - $27,500.00 = $100.00 (underpaid)

**Client C:**
- Total commission due: $10,360.00
- Payments received: $7,500.00 + $2,000.00 = $9,500.00
- Discrepancy: $10,360.00 - $9,500.00 = $860.00 (underpaid)

**Underpaid clients:** All clients (A, B, and C) have underpaid their commissions.

### Task 3: Apply Contract Payment Terms

**Client A:**
- Film Role payment received by client on June 5th (from email)
- Due date: June 5th + 15 days = June 20, 2023
- TV Commercial payment: Received by client April 15th, due April 30th (15 days later)
- Paid on May 5th (5 days late)
- Late fee: $4,500 × 1.5% × (5/30) = $9.00 (prorated for 5 days)

**Client B:**
- Tournament Prize payment received by client on June 7th (from email)
- Due date: June 7th + 30 days = July 7, 2023
- Payment made on July 15th (8 days late)
- New late fee: $10,200 × 2% × (8/30) = $54.40
- Plus existing late fee mentioned in email: $350.00
- Total late fee: $350.00 + $54.40 = $404.40

**Client C:**
- Merchandise Sales payment received by client on June 20th (from email)
- Due date: June 20th + 45 days = August 4, 2023
- No late fees (payment not yet due at time of exam)
- Late fee: $0.00

### Task 4: Process Payment Allocation (Client B)

- Recent payment from Client B: $10,000.00
- Outstanding late fee (from email): $350.00
- Commission due for Tournament Prize: $85,000 × 15% = $10,200.00 (since this falls within the first $100K for the quarter)
- Payment application order per contract: (1) Late fees, (2) Current commissions, (3) Past due amounts
- Allocation:
  - To late fees: $350.00
  - To current commission: $10,000.00 - $350.00 = $9,650.00
  - To previous commission: $0.00 (current commission not fully paid)
  - Remaining balance owed: $10,200.00 - $9,650.00 = $550.00

### Task 5: Verify Payment Method Compliance

**Client A:**
- Contract requires direct deposit only
- Email indicates a check was sent for the Film Role commission
- Compliance: **false** (non-compliant)

**Client B:**
- Contract requires wire transfer only
- Payment history shows wire transfers used for both payments
- Compliance: **true** (compliant)

**Client C:**
- Contract allows check or PayPal
- Payment history shows PayPal used for both payments
- Compliance: **true** (compliant)

## Passing Criteria

To pass this basic practical exam, candidates must:

1. **Overall Score:** Achieve at least 80% accuracy across all tasks (16 out of 20 points)
2. **Critical Tasks:** Correctly complete at least 3 out of the 5 tasks with 100% accuracy

### Point Distribution:
- Task 1: 3 points (1 point per client)
- Task 2: 4 points (1 point per client discrepancy, 1 point for correct underpaid clients list)
- Task 3: 6 points (1 point per client due date, 1 point per client late fee)
- Task 4: 4 points (1 point per allocation category)
- Task 5: 3 points (1 point per client compliance assessment)

### Grading Notes:
- For numerical values, answers within ±$0.10 of the correct amount should be considered correct to account for minor rounding differences.
- For dates, only exact matches should be accepted.
- For the underpaid clients list, the order of clients doesn't matter, but all underpaid clients must be included with no extras.
- For boolean values, only exact matches should be accepted.

This exam tests fundamental skills in commission calculation, contract term application, and payment processing that are essential for agents and business managers working with artists, performers, and athletes. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","I'll create a Python script that evaluates a candidate's submission against the answer key and generates a detailed test results file with an overall score.

This script:

1. Loads both the candidate's submission and the answer key from JSON files
2. Evaluates each task according to the specified criteria:
   - For numerical values, allows a tolerance of ±$0.10 to account for rounding differences
   - For dates and boolean values, requires exact matches
   - For the underpaid clients list, checks that the sets match (order doesn't matter)
3. Calculates points for each task and an overall score as a percentage
4. Determines if the candidate passed based on:
   - Achieving at least 80% overall accuracy (16/20 points)
   - Having at least 3 out of 5 tasks fully correct (100% accuracy)
5. Saves detailed results to a JSON file including:
   - Candidate ID
   - Detailed breakdown of each task with submitted vs. expected values
   - Points earned per task and overall
   - Whether the candidate passed or failed

The output file `test_results.json` will contain all this information in a structured format, with the overall score expressed as a percentage.","I'll solve this practical exam step by step using the provided materials.

## Task 1: Calculate Commission Amounts

First, I need to calculate the commission for each client based on their contract terms and income.

**Client A (John Smith):**
- TV Commercial: $45,000 × 10% = $4,500
- Film Role: $75,000 × 10% = $7,500
- Total commission: $12,000

**Client B (Elite Basketball Team):**
- Total income: $120,000 (Sponsorship) + $85,000 (Tournament) = $205,000
- First $100,000 at 15% = $15,000
- Remaining $105,000 at 12% = $12,600
- Total commission: $27,600

**Client C (Sarah Jones):**
- Concert Tour: $65,000 × 12% = $7,800
- Merchandise Sales: $32,000 × 8% = $2,560
- Total commission: $10,360

## Task 2: Identify Payment Discrepancies

Now I'll calculate the difference between expected commissions and actual payments.

**Client A:**
- Expected: $12,000
- Paid: $4,500 + $7,000 = $11,500
- Discrepancy: $12,000 - $11,500 = $500

**Client B:**
- Expected: $27,600
- Paid: $17,500 + $10,000 = $27,500
- Discrepancy: $27,600 - $27,500 = $100

**Client C:**
- Expected: $10,360
- Paid: $7,500 + $2,000 = $9,500
- Discrepancy: $10,360 - $9,500 = $860

Underpaid clients: A, B, C (all have discrepancies)

## Task 3: Apply Contract Payment Terms

**Client A:**
- Film Role payment received by client on June 5th (from email)
- Due date: June 5th + 15 days = June 20, 2023
- Payment made on June 15th, so no late fee

**Client B:**
- Tournament Prize payment received by client on June 7th (from email)
- Due date: June 7th + 30 days = July 7, 2023
- Payment made on July 15th, which is 8 days late
- Late fee: 2% per month = 0.0667% per day
- Late fee amount: $10,200 (tournament commission) × 0.0667% × 8 days = $54.40

**Client C:**
- Merchandise Sales payment received by client on June 20th (from email)
- Due date: June 20th + 45 days = August 4, 2023
- Payment made on July 30th, so no late fee

## Task 4: Process Payment Allocation

For Client B's recent payment of $10,000 on July 15th:

1. Outstanding late fees: $350 (mentioned in email)
2. Current commission for Tournament Prize: $10,200 (85,000 × 12% = $10,200)
3. Previous unpaid commissions: $100 (from Task 2)

Allocation:
- Late fees: $350
- Current commission: $9,650 (partial payment of the $10,200)
- Previous commission: $0 (not enough to cover)
- Remaining balance: $0

## Task 5: Verify Payment Method Compliance

**Client A:**
- Required method: Direct Deposit
- Actual method for Film Role: Check (from email)
- Not compliant

**Client B:**
- Required method: Wire Transfer
- Actual method: Wire Transfer
- Compliant

**Client C:**
- Required method: Check or PayPal
- Actual method: PayPal
- Compliant

# Entertainment and Sports Industry Trends and Deals
## Recent News and Analysis
### April 2023

---

## SECTION 1: CURRENT INDUSTRY TRENDS

### Streaming Platforms Shift to Sports Rights Acquisition
*Source: Entertainment Business Weekly, April 10, 2023*

Major streaming platforms including Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Apple TV+ have dramatically increased their spending on live sports rights in Q1 2023. Netflix recently secured partial rights to NBA games for $1.5 billion over three years, while Amazon expanded its NFL coverage with an additional $1.2 billion deal. Apple TV+ has acquired MLB weekday game rights for $550 million.

Industry analysts note this represents a 35% increase in streaming platform sports spending compared to 2022. Traditional networks like ESPN and Fox Sports are responding by focusing on exclusive playoff and championship content while raising their digital subscription offerings.

""The streaming wars have officially entered the sports arena,"" notes media analyst Sarah Chen. ""For talent representatives, this creates new leverage opportunities but also complicates rights negotiations as digital and traditional boundaries blur.""

---

### AI-Generated Content Disrupting Production Economics
*Source: Digital Media Today, April 5, 2023*

Studios and production companies are increasingly incorporating AI tools into content creation, with Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney both launching AI divisions in March 2023. Initial reports indicate a 22% reduction in production costs for projects utilizing AI for background generation, script development, and preliminary editing.

The Screen Actors Guild and Writers Guild have both issued statements expressing concern, with SAG-AFTRA specifically addressing the need for clear contractual language regarding digital likeness rights and residual payments for AI-assisted productions.

""We're seeing contracts without adequate protection for performers whose work might be used to train these systems,"" said union representative Michael Torres. ""Agents need to scrutinize new contract language carefully, especially for voice actors and background performers.""

---

### Brand Integration Deals Surpass Traditional Endorsements
*Source: Marketing Insider, April 12, 2023*

Corporate sponsorship structures are evolving, with brand integration deals now representing 58% of celebrity-brand partnerships in Q1 2023, up from 41% in 2022. These arrangements typically involve equity stakes, creative input, and multi-platform promotion rather than traditional flat-fee endorsements.

Notable recent examples include athlete Serena Williams' strategic partnership with fintech company Klarna (valued at $15 million plus equity) and actor Ryan Reynolds' continued success with Aviation Gin and Mint Mobile, both involving significant ownership positions.

""The one-off endorsement deal is becoming obsolete for A-list talent,"" explains marketing executive Priya Patel. ""Today's most valuable arrangements involve long-term brand building with shared upside potential.""

---

### Olympic Sponsorship Rates Surge Ahead of 2024 Paris Games
*Source: Sports Business Journal, April 3, 2023*

With the 2024 Paris Olympics approaching, sponsorship rates for Olympic athletes have increased by an average of 28% compared to the Tokyo cycle. Top-tier athletes in swimming, track, and gymnastics are commanding $750,000-$2 million for major brand partnerships, while even emerging athletes in these sports are seeing $150,000-$300,000 deals.

The IOC has also expanded its Rule 40 exemptions, allowing athletes greater freedom to promote personal sponsors during the Games period, though specific blackout restrictions still apply.

""The combination of relaxed rules and pent-up demand after the restricted Tokyo Games has created a seller's market,"" notes Olympic marketing specialist Jean Dupont. ""Agents should be aggressive in negotiations but mindful of the specific timing restrictions that still exist.""

---

### Podcast Talent Acquisition Heats Up
*Source: Audio Industry Report, April 8, 2023*

Exclusive podcast deals continue to command premium prices in 2023, with Spotify, Amazon's Wondery, and SiriusXM competing for top creators. Recent deals include Spotify signing true crime producer Sarah Koenig for $28 million over three years and Wondery securing sports commentator Bill Simmons for $25 million.

Platform exclusivity remains the primary driver of high valuations, though recent contracts show more flexibility in content ownership and future distribution rights. Most deals now include a ""reversion clause"" returning IP rights to creators after 2-3 years.

""The podcast market is maturing,"" says audio agent David Chen. ""The deals are still lucrative, but we're seeing more sophisticated terms regarding IP retention, production support, and marketing commitments from platforms.""

- Provide a reasonable impact score (5-10 would be appropriate for most of these trends)
- List implications that logically connect to the trend

## Task 2: Deal Structure Comparison - Evaluation Guidelines

For Task 2, candidates must compare two television actor deals. The correct analysis should include:

- Deal 1 (James Martinez) total compensation: $3,300,000 base ($150,000 × 22 episodes)
- Deal 2 (Maria Chen) total compensation: $3,000,000 base ($300,000 × 10 episodes) + potential $2M performance bonus
- Deal 1 term length: 36 months (3-year contract)
- Deal 2 term length: 24 months (2-year contract with option)
- Deal 1 rights retained: Film projects during hiatus, character likeness rights except for show promotion
- Deal 2 rights retained: Non-competing projects during hiatus, character likeness rights except for show promotion and limited merchandise
- More favorable deal: Deal 2 (Maria Chen's Netflix deal) is generally more favorable due to higher per-episode rate, performance bonus potential, better merchandising royalty (7% vs 5%), and fewer social media obligations, despite the shorter term length

## Task 3: Client Advisory Scenario - Evaluation Guidelines

For Task 3, candidates must analyze the emerging platforms in Section 3. Strong responses should:

- Platform selection: Either TikTok Creator Marketplace or YouTube Shorts would be most appropriate for audience expansion (both have over 1 billion users). Substack could be justified for certain talent types but has a smaller audience.
- Compensation recommendation: Should align with the ""mid-tier"" ranges provided for the selected platform:
  * TikTok: $25,000-$50,000 per campaign
  * YouTube Shorts: $20,000-$45,000 per integration
  * Twitch: $10,000-$30,000 monthly
  * Substack: $5,000-$20,000 monthly
  * Clubhouse/Twitter Spaces: $5,000-$15,000 per event
- Rights recommendation: Should reflect the platform-specific rights structures mentioned and protect the talent's interests
- Supporting trend evidence: Should connect to trends mentioned in Section 1 (e.g., brand integration trend, streaming platform competition)

## Common Pitfalls to Watch For

1. Candidates might miss the performance bonus in Deal 2 when calculating total compensation
2. Candidates might not recognize the value of fewer social media obligations in Deal 2
3. Candidates might select a platform with smaller reach when the scenario specifically mentions audience expansion
4. Candidates might recommend compensation outside the ranges provided for mid-career talent

## Hidden Information Requiring Careful Reading

1. The materials subtly indicate that Deal 2 has better merchandising terms (7% vs 5%)
2. The materials note that Deal 1 requires specific social media post counts while Deal 2 only requires ""reasonable promotional efforts""
3. The platform analysis includes both user numbers and recent notable deals that provide context for appropriate compensation levels
4. The trends section contains specific percentage increases (e.g., 35% increase in streaming platform sports spending) that support impact assessments

## SECTION 1: CURRENT INDUSTRY TRENDS

### Streaming Platforms Shift to Sports Rights Acquisition
*Source: Entertainment Business Weekly, April 10, 2023*

Major streaming platforms including Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Apple TV+ have dramatically increased their spending on live sports rights in Q1 2023. Netflix recently secured partial rights to NBA games for $1.5 billion over three years, while Amazon expanded its NFL coverage with an additional $1.2 billion deal. Apple TV+ has acquired MLB weekday game rights for $550 million.

Industry analysts note this represents a 35% increase in streaming platform sports spending compared to 2022. Traditional networks like ESPN and Fox Sports are responding by focusing on exclusive playoff and championship content while raising their digital subscription offerings.

""The streaming wars have officially entered the sports arena,"" notes media analyst Sarah Chen. ""For talent representatives, this creates new leverage opportunities but also complicates rights negotiations as digital and traditional boundaries blur.""

---

### AI-Generated Content Disrupting Production Economics
*Source: Digital Media Today, April 5, 2023*

Studios and production companies are increasingly incorporating AI tools into content creation, with Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney both launching AI divisions in March 2023. Initial reports indicate a 22% reduction in production costs for projects utilizing AI for background generation, script development, and preliminary editing.

The Screen Actors Guild and Writers Guild have both issued statements expressing concern, with SAG-AFTRA specifically addressing the need for clear contractual language regarding digital likeness rights and residual payments for AI-assisted productions.

""We're seeing contracts without adequate protection for performers whose work might be used to train these systems,"" said union representative Michael Torres. ""Agents need to scrutinize new contract language carefully, especially for voice actors and background performers.""

---

### Brand Integration Deals Surpass Traditional Endorsements
*Source: Marketing Insider, April 12, 2023*

Corporate sponsorship structures are evolving, with brand integration deals now representing 58% of celebrity-brand partnerships in Q1 2023, up from 41% in 2022. These arrangements typically involve equity stakes, creative input, and multi-platform promotion rather than traditional flat-fee endorsements.

Notable recent examples include athlete Serena Williams' strategic partnership with fintech company Klarna (valued at $15 million plus equity) and actor Ryan Reynolds' continued success with Aviation Gin and Mint Mobile, both involving significant ownership positions.

""The one-off endorsement deal is becoming obsolete for A-list talent,"" explains marketing executive Priya Patel. ""Today's most valuable arrangements involve long-term brand building with shared upside potential.""

---

### Olympic Sponsorship Rates Surge Ahead of 2024 Paris Games
*Source: Sports Business Journal, April 3, 2023*

With the 2024 Paris Olympics approaching, sponsorship rates for Olympic athletes have increased by an average of 28% compared to the Tokyo cycle. Top-tier athletes in swimming, track, and gymnastics are commanding $750,000-$2 million for major brand partnerships, while even emerging athletes in these sports are seeing $150,000-$300,000 deals.

The IOC has also expanded its Rule 40 exemptions, allowing athletes greater freedom to promote personal sponsors during the Games period, though specific blackout restrictions still apply.

""The combination of relaxed rules and pent-up demand after the restricted Tokyo Games has created a seller's market,"" notes Olympic marketing specialist Jean Dupont. ""Agents should be aggressive in negotiations but mindful of the specific timing restrictions that still exist.""

---

### Podcast Talent Acquisition Heats Up
*Source: Audio Industry Report, April 8, 2023*

Exclusive podcast deals continue to command premium prices in 2023, with Spotify, Amazon's Wondery, and SiriusXM competing for top creators. Recent deals include Spotify signing true crime producer Sarah Koenig for $28 million over three years and Wondery securing sports commentator Bill Simmons for $25 million.

Platform exclusivity remains the primary driver of high valuations, though recent contracts show more flexibility in content ownership and future distribution rights. Most deals now include a ""reversion clause"" returning IP rights to creators after 2-3 years.

""The podcast market is maturing,"" says audio agent David Chen. ""The deals are still lucrative, but we're seeing more sophisticated terms regarding IP retention, production support, and marketing commitments from platforms.""

<MATERIALS_EXPLANATION_FOR_EVALUATOR>
# Explanation of Exam Materials for Evaluator

## Overview
The provided materials simulate a current industry report containing three key sections that candidates must analyze to complete the exam tasks:
1. Current Industry Trends
2. Recent Deal Structures
3. Emerging Distribution Platforms

All materials are synthetic but designed to reflect realistic industry patterns and data points that a competent agent or business manager would be expected to identify and interpret.

## Task 1: Industry News Analysis - Evaluation Guidelines

For Task 1, candidates should identify three significant trends from Section 1 of the materials. The five trends presented are:

1. Streaming platforms shifting to sports rights acquisition
2. AI-generated content disrupting production economics
3. Brand integration deals surpassing traditional endorsements
4. Olympic sponsorship rates surging ahead of 2024 Paris Games
5. Podcast talent acquisition heating up

A strong response will:
- Correctly identify trends (any three of the five provided)
- Accurately cite the source as provided in the materials
- Provide a reasonable impact score (5-10 would be appropriate for most of these trends)
- List implications that logically connect to the trend

## Task 2: Deal Structure Comparison - Evaluation Guidelines

For Task 2, candidates must compare two television actor deals. The correct analysis should include:

- Deal 1 (James Martinez) total compensation: $3,300,000 base ($150,000 × 22 episodes)
- Deal 2 (Maria Chen) total compensation: $3,000,000 base ($300,000 × 10 episodes) + potential $2M performance bonus
- Deal 1 term length: 36 months (3-year contract)
- Deal 2 term length: 24 months (2-year contract with option)
- Deal 1 rights retained: Film projects during hiatus, character likeness rights except for show promotion
- Deal 2 rights retained: Non-competing projects during hiatus, character likeness rights except for show promotion and limited merchandise
- More favorable deal: Deal 2 (Maria Chen's Netflix deal) is generally more favorable due to higher per-episode rate, performance bonus potential, better merchandising royalty (7% vs 5%), and fewer social media obligations, despite the shorter term length

## Task 3: Client Advisory Scenario - Evaluation Guidelines

For Task 3, candidates must analyze the emerging platforms in Section 3. Strong responses should:

- Platform selection: Either TikTok Creator Marketplace or YouTube Shorts would be most appropriate for audience expansion (both have over 1 billion users). Substack could be justified for certain talent types but has a smaller audience.
- Compensation recommendation: Should align with the ""mid-tier"" ranges provided for the selected platform:
  * TikTok: $25,000-$50,000 per campaign
  * YouTube Shorts: $20,000-$45,000 per integration
  * Twitch: $10,000-$30,000 monthly
  * Substack: $5,000-$20,000 monthly
  * Clubhouse/Twitter Spaces: $5,000-$15,000 per event
- Rights recommendation: Should reflect the platform-specific rights structures mentioned and protect the talent's interests
- Supporting trend evidence: Should connect to trends mentioned in Section 1 (e.g., brand integration trend, streaming platform competition)

## Common Pitfalls to Watch For

1. Candidates might miss the performance bonus in Deal 2 when calculating total compensation
2. Candidates might not recognize the value of fewer social media obligations in Deal 2
3. Candidates might select a platform with smaller reach when the scenario specifically mentions audience expansion
4. Candidates might recommend compensation outside the ranges provided for mid-career talent

## Hidden Information Requiring Careful Reading

1. The materials subtly indicate that Deal 2 has better merchandising terms (7% vs 5%)
2. The materials note that Deal 1 requires specific social media post counts while Deal 2 only requires ""reasonable promotional efforts""
3. The platform analysis includes both user numbers and recent notable deals that provide context for appropriate compensation levels
4. The trends section contains specific percentage increases (e.g., 35% increase in streaming platform sports spending) that support impact assessments

# Entertainment and Sports Industry Trends and Deals
## Recent News and Analysis
### April 2023

---

## SECTION 1: CURRENT INDUSTRY TRENDS

### Streaming Platforms Shift to Sports Rights Acquisition
*Source: Entertainment Business Weekly, April 10, 2023*

Major streaming platforms including Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Apple TV+ have dramatically increased their spending on live sports rights in Q1 2023. Netflix recently secured partial rights to NBA games for $1.5 billion over three years, while Amazon expanded its NFL coverage with an additional $1.2 billion deal. Apple TV+ has acquired MLB weekday game rights for $550 million.

Industry analysts note this represents a 35% increase in streaming platform sports spending compared to 2022. Traditional networks like ESPN and Fox Sports are responding by focusing on exclusive playoff and championship content while raising their digital subscription offerings.

""The streaming wars have officially entered the sports arena,"" notes media analyst Sarah Chen. ""For talent representatives, this creates new leverage opportunities but also complicates rights negotiations as digital and traditional boundaries blur.""

---

### AI-Generated Content Disrupting Production Economics
*Source: Digital Media Today, April 5, 2023*

Studios and production companies are increasingly incorporating AI tools into content creation, with Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney both launching AI divisions in March 2023. Initial reports indicate a 22% reduction in production costs for projects utilizing AI for background generation, script development, and preliminary editing.

The Screen Actors Guild and Writers Guild have both issued statements expressing concern, with SAG-AFTRA specifically addressing the need for clear contractual language regarding digital likeness rights and residual payments for AI-assisted productions.

""We're seeing contracts without adequate protection for performers whose work might be used to train these systems,"" said union representative Michael Torres. ""Agents need to scrutinize new contract language carefully, especially for voice actors and background performers.""

---

### Brand Integration Deals Surpass Traditional Endorsements
*Source: Marketing Insider, April 12, 2023*

Corporate sponsorship structures are evolving, with brand integration deals now representing 58% of celebrity-brand partnerships in Q1 2023, up from 41% in 2022. These arrangements typically involve equity stakes, creative input, and multi-platform promotion rather than traditional flat-fee endorsements.

Notable recent examples include athlete Serena Williams' strategic partnership with fintech company Klarna (valued at $15 million plus equity) and actor Ryan Reynolds' continued success with Aviation Gin and Mint Mobile, both involving significant ownership positions.

""The one-off endorsement deal is becoming obsolete for A-list talent,"" explains marketing executive Priya Patel. ""Today's most valuable arrangements involve long-term brand building with shared upside potential.""

---

### Olympic Sponsorship Rates Surge Ahead of 2024 Paris Games
*Source: Sports Business Journal, April 3, 2023*

With the 2024 Paris Olympics approaching, sponsorship rates for Olympic athletes have increased by an average of 28% compared to the Tokyo cycle. Top-tier athletes in swimming, track, and gymnastics are commanding $750,000-$2 million for major brand partnerships, while even emerging athletes in these sports are seeing $150,000-$300,000 deals.

The IOC has also expanded its Rule 40 exemptions, allowing athletes greater freedom to promote personal sponsors during the Games period, though specific blackout restrictions still apply.

""The combination of relaxed rules and pent-up demand after the restricted Tokyo Games has created a seller's market,"" notes Olympic marketing specialist Jean Dupont. ""Agents should be aggressive in negotiations but mindful of the specific timing restrictions that still exist.""

---

### Podcast Talent Acquisition Heats Up
*Source: Audio Industry Report, April 8, 2023*

Exclusive podcast deals continue to command premium prices in 2023, with Spotify, Amazon's Wondery, and SiriusXM competing for top creators. Recent deals include Spotify signing true crime producer Sarah Koenig for $28 million over three years and Wondery securing sports commentator Bill Simmons for $25 million.

Platform exclusivity remains the primary driver of high valuations, though recent contracts show more flexibility in content ownership and future distribution rights. Most deals now include a ""reversion clause"" returning IP rights to creators after 2-3 years.

""The podcast market is maturing,"" says audio agent David Chen. ""The deals are still lucrative, but we're seeing more sophisticated terms regarding IP retention, production support, and marketing commitments from platforms.""

<MATERIALS_EXPLANATION_FOR_EVALUATOR>
# Explanation of Exam Materials for Evaluator

## Overview
The provided materials simulate a current industry report containing three key sections that candidates must analyze to complete the exam tasks:
1. Current Industry Trends
2. Recent Deal Structures
3. Emerging Distribution Platforms

All materials are synthetic but designed to reflect realistic industry patterns and data points that a competent agent or business manager would be expected to identify and interpret.

## Task 1: Industry News Analysis - Evaluation Guidelines

For Task 1, candidates should identify three significant trends from Section 1 of the materials. The five trends presented are:

1. Streaming platforms shifting to sports rights acquisition
2. AI-generated content disrupting production economics
3. Brand integration deals surpassing traditional endorsements
4. Olympic sponsorship rates surging ahead of 2024 Paris Games
5. Podcast talent acquisition heating up

A strong response will:
- Correctly identify trends (any three of the five provided)
- Accurately cite the source as provided in the materials
- Provide a reasonable impact score (5-10 would be appropriate for most of these trends)
- List implications that logically connect to the trend

## Task 2: Deal Structure Comparison - Evaluation Guidelines

For Task 2, candidates must compare two television actor deals. The correct analysis should include:

- Deal 1 (James Martinez) total compensation: $3,300,000 base ($150,000 × 22 episodes)
- Deal 2 (Maria Chen) total compensation: $3,000,000 base ($300,000 × 10 episodes) + potential $2M performance bonus
- Deal 1 term length: 36 months (3-year contract)
- Deal 2 term length: 24 months (2-year contract with option)
- Deal 1 rights retained: Film projects during hiatus, character likeness rights except for show promotion
- Deal 2 rights retained: Non-competing projects during hiatus, character likeness rights except for show promotion and limited merchandise
- More favorable deal: Deal 2 (Maria Chen's Netflix deal) is generally more favorable due to higher per-episode rate, performance bonus potential, better merchandising royalty (7% vs 5%), and fewer social media obligations, despite the shorter term length

## Task 3: Client Advisory Scenario - Evaluation Guidelines

For Task 3, candidates must analyze the emerging platforms in Section 3. Strong responses should:

- Platform selection: Either TikTok Creator Marketplace or YouTube Shorts would be most appropriate for audience expansion (both have over 1 billion users). Substack could be justified for certain talent types but has a smaller audience.
- Compensation recommendation: Should align with the ""mid-tier"" ranges provided for the selected platform:
  * TikTok: $25,000-$50,000 per campaign
  * YouTube Shorts: $20,000-$45,000 per integration
  * Twitch: $10,000-$30,000 monthly
  * Substack: $5,000-$20,000 monthly
  * Clubhouse/Twitter Spaces: $5,000-$15,000 per event
- Rights recommendation: Should reflect the platform-specific rights structures mentioned and protect the talent's interests
- Supporting trend evidence: Should connect to trends mentioned in Section 1 (e.g., brand integration trend, streaming platform competition)

## Common Pitfalls to Watch For

1. Candidates might miss the performance bonus in Deal 2 when calculating total compensation
2. Candidates might not recognize the value of fewer social media obligations in Deal 2
3. Candidates might select a platform with smaller reach when the scenario specifically mentions audience expansion
4. Candidates might recommend compensation outside the ranges provided for mid-career talent

## Hidden Information Requiring Careful Reading

1. The materials subtly indicate that Deal 2 has better merchandising terms (7% vs 5%)
2. The materials note that Deal 1 requires specific social media post counts while Deal 2 only requires ""reasonable promotional efforts""
3. The platform analysis includes both user numbers and recent notable deals that provide context for appropriate compensation levels
4. The trends section contains specific percentage increases (e.g., 35% increase in streaming platform sports spending) that support impact assessments

4. Olympic Sponsorship Rates Surge Ahead of 2024 Paris Games
5. Podcast Talent Acquisition Heats Up

**Impact Scores:**
- Scores between 6-10 are reasonable for any of these trends, as they all represent significant industry developments
- Lower scores (1-5) would require strong justification given the material's emphasis on these trends' importance

**Key Implications:**
- Acceptable implications should logically connect to the trend and focus on how talent representatives would be affected
- The sample answer provides implications directly derived from the materials, but candidates may offer other valid implications if they logically connect to the trend

### Task 2: Deal Structure Comparison

**Compensation Calculation:**
- Deal 1: $150,000 × 22 episodes = $3,300,000 base compensation
- Deal 2: $300,000 × 10 episodes = $3,000,000 base + $2,000,000 potential performance bonus = $5,000,000 total
  (The performance bonus should be included as it represents significant potential compensation)

**Term Length:**
- Deal 1: 3-year contract = 36 months
- Deal 2: 2-year contract = 24 months

**Rights Retained:**
For Deal 1:
- Right to pursue film projects during hiatus periods
- Character likeness rights except for show promotion
- First-position priority to series production schedule

For Deal 2:
- Right to pursue film and television projects with non-competing services
- Character likeness rights except for show promotion and limited merchandise
- Subject to reasonable scheduling accommodation

**More Favorable Deal:**
Deal 2 (Maria Chen's Netflix deal) is more favorable because:
- Higher per-episode compensation ($300,000 vs $150,000)
- Potential $2M performance bonus
- Better merchandising royalty (7% vs 5%)
- Fewer social media obligations (reasonable efforts vs 3 posts per week)
- More flexibility to pursue other projects (both film and TV vs film only)
- Shorter commitment period (24 months vs 36 months)

### Task 3: Client Advisory Scenario

**Platform Selection:**
TikTok Creator Marketplace or YouTube Shorts are the strongest choices for audience expansion:
- Both have over 1 billion monthly active users
- Both offer substantial compensation for mid-tier talent
- Both allow content ownership retention

**Compensation Recommendation:**
For a mid-career talent, the materials provide these ranges:
- TikTok: $25,000-$50,000 per branded campaign
- YouTube Shorts: $20,000-$45,000 per branded integration
- Twitch: $10,000-$30,000 monthly
- Substack: $5,000-$20,000 monthly
- Clubhouse/Twitter Spaces: $5,000-$15,000 per sponsored room/event

Any recommendation within the appropriate range for the selected platform is acceptable.

**Rights Recommendation:**
Strong recommendations should protect the talent's interests while reflecting platform norms:
- Content ownership retention
- Limiting exclusivity periods
- Maintaining control over personal brand
- Retaining subscriber/follower data
- Securing approval rights for branded content

**Supporting Trend Evidence:**
Valid supporting trends include:
- Brand integration deals surpassing traditional endorsements
- Streaming platforms competing for exclusive content
- Podcast talent acquisition demonstrating premium value for exclusive content
- AI-generated content concerns (if recommending rights protections)

## Passing Criteria

- Demonstrated ability to extract and apply relevant information from industry materials

**Critical Components for Passing:**
1. Identifying the performance bonus in Deal 2's compensation
2. Recognizing Deal 2 as more favorable overall
3. Selecting a platform with substantial audience reach
4. Recommending compensation within appropriate ranges for mid-tier talent","

# Entertainment and Sports Industry Trends and Deals
## Recent News and Analysis
### April 2023

---

## SECTION 1: CURRENT INDUSTRY TRENDS

### Streaming Platforms Shift to Sports Rights Acquisition
*Source: Entertainment Business Weekly, April 10, 2023*

Major streaming platforms including Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Apple TV+ have dramatically increased their spending on live sports rights in Q1 2023. Netflix recently secured partial rights to NBA games for $1.5 billion over three years, while Amazon expanded its NFL coverage with an additional $1.2 billion deal. Apple TV+ has acquired MLB weekday game rights for $550 million.

Industry analysts note this represents a 35% increase in streaming platform sports spending compared to 2022. Traditional networks like ESPN and Fox Sports are responding by focusing on exclusive playoff and championship content while raising their digital subscription offerings.

""The streaming wars have officially entered the sports arena,"" notes media analyst Sarah Chen. ""For talent representatives, this creates new leverage opportunities but also complicates rights negotiations as digital and traditional boundaries blur.""

---

### AI-Generated Content Disrupting Production Economics
*Source: Digital Media Today, April 5, 2023*

Studios and production companies are increasingly incorporating AI tools into content creation, with Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney both launching AI divisions in March 2023. Initial reports indicate a 22% reduction in production costs for projects utilizing AI for background generation, script development, and preliminary editing.

The Screen Actors Guild and Writers Guild have both issued statements expressing concern, with SAG-AFTRA specifically addressing the need for clear contractual language regarding digital likeness rights and residual payments for AI-assisted productions.

""We're seeing contracts without adequate protection for performers whose work might be used to train these systems,"" said union representative Michael Torres. ""Agents need to scrutinize new contract language carefully, especially for voice actors and background performers.""

---

### Brand Integration Deals Surpass Traditional Endorsements
*Source: Marketing Insider, April 12, 2023*

Corporate sponsorship structures are evolving, with brand integration deals now representing 58% of celebrity-brand partnerships in Q1 2023, up from 41% in 2022. These arrangements typically involve equity stakes, creative input, and multi-platform promotion rather than traditional flat-fee endorsements.

Notable recent examples include athlete Serena Williams' strategic partnership with fintech company Klarna (valued at $15 million plus equity) and actor Ryan Reynolds' continued success with Aviation Gin and Mint Mobile, both involving significant ownership positions.

""The one-off endorsement deal is becoming obsolete for A-list talent,"" explains marketing executive Priya Patel. ""Today's most valuable arrangements involve long-term brand building with shared upside potential.""

---

### Olympic Sponsorship Rates Surge Ahead of 2024 Paris Games
*Source: Sports Business Journal, April 3, 2023*

With the 2024 Paris Olympics approaching, sponsorship rates for Olympic athletes have increased by an average of 28% compared to the Tokyo cycle. Top-tier athletes in swimming, track, and gymnastics are commanding $750,000-$2 million for major brand partnerships, while even emerging athletes in these sports are seeing $150,000-$300,000 deals.

The IOC has also expanded its Rule 40 exemptions, allowing athletes greater freedom to promote personal sponsors during the Games period, though specific blackout restrictions still apply.

""The combination of relaxed rules and pent-up demand after the restricted Tokyo Games has created a seller's market,"" notes Olympic marketing specialist Jean Dupont. ""Agents should be aggressive in negotiations but mindful of the specific timing restrictions that still exist.""

---

### Podcast Talent Acquisition Heats Up
*Source: Audio Industry Report, April 8, 2023*

Exclusive podcast deals continue to command premium prices in 2023, with Spotify, Amazon's Wondery, and SiriusXM competing for top creators. Recent deals include Spotify signing true crime producer Sarah Koenig for $28 million over three years and Wondery securing sports commentator Bill Simmons for $25 million.

Platform exclusivity remains the primary driver of high valuations, though recent contracts show more flexibility in content ownership and future distribution rights. Most deals now include a ""reversion clause"" returning IP rights to creators after 2-3 years.

""The podcast market is maturing,"" says audio agent David Chen. ""The deals are still lucrative, but we're seeing more sophisticated terms regarding IP retention, production support, and marketing commitments from platforms.""

<MATERIALS_EXPLANATION_FOR_EVALUATOR>
# Explanation of Exam Materials for Evaluator

## Overview
The provided materials simulate a current industry report containing three key sections that candidates must analyze to complete the exam tasks:
1. Current Industry Trends
2. Recent Deal Structures
3. Emerging Distribution Platforms

All materials are synthetic but designed to reflect realistic industry patterns and data points that a competent agent or business manager would be expected to identify and interpret.

## Task 1: Industry News Analysis - Evaluation Guidelines

For Task 1, candidates should identify three significant trends from Section 1 of the materials. The five trends presented are:

1. Streaming platforms shifting to sports rights acquisition
2. AI-generated content disrupting production economics
3. Brand integration deals surpassing traditional endorsements
4. Olympic sponsorship rates surging ahead of 2024 Paris Games
5. Podcast talent acquisition heating up

A strong response will:
- Correctly identify trends (any three of the five provided)
- Accurately cite the source as provided in the materials
- Provide a reasonable impact score (5-10 would be appropriate for most of these trends)
- List implications that logically connect to the trend

## Task 2: Deal Structure Comparison - Evaluation Guidelines

For Task 2, candidates must compare two television actor deals. The correct analysis should include:

- Deal 1 (James Martinez) total compensation: $3,300,000 base ($150,000 × 22 episodes)
- Deal 2 (Maria Chen) total compensation: $3,000,000 base ($300,000 × 10 episodes) + potential $2M performance bonus
- Deal 1 term length: 36 months (3-year contract)
- Deal 2 term length: 24 months (2-year contract with option)
- Deal 1 rights retained: Film projects during hiatus, character likeness rights except for show promotion
- Deal 2 rights retained: Non-competing projects during hiatus, character likeness rights except for show promotion and limited merchandise
- More favorable deal: Deal 2 (Maria Chen's Netflix deal) is generally more favorable due to higher per-episode rate, performance bonus potential, better merchandising royalty (7% vs 5%), and fewer social media obligations, despite the shorter term length

## Task 3: Client Advisory Scenario - Evaluation Guidelines

For Task 3, candidates must analyze the emerging platforms in Section 3. Strong responses should:

- Platform selection: Either TikTok Creator Marketplace or YouTube Shorts would be most appropriate for audience expansion (both have over 1 billion users). Substack could be justified for certain talent types but has a smaller audience.
- Compensation recommendation: Should align with the ""mid-tier"" ranges provided for the selected platform:
  * TikTok: $25,000-$50,000 per campaign
  * YouTube Shorts: $20,000-$45,000 per integration
  * Twitch: $10,000-$30,000 monthly
  * Substack: $5,000-$20,000 monthly
  * Clubhouse/Twitter Spaces: $5,000-$15,000 per event
- Rights recommendation: Should reflect the platform-specific rights structures mentioned and protect the talent's interests
- Supporting trend evidence: Should connect to trends mentioned in Section 1 (e.g., brand integration trend, streaming platform competition)

## Common Pitfalls to Watch For

1. Candidates might miss the performance bonus in Deal 2 when calculating total compensation
2. Candidates might not recognize the value of fewer social media obligations in Deal 2
3. Candidates might select a platform with smaller reach when the scenario specifically mentions audience expansion
4. Candidates might recommend compensation outside the ranges provided for mid-career talent

## Hidden Information Requiring Careful Reading

1. The materials subtly indicate that Deal 2 has better merchandising terms (7% vs 5%)
2. The materials note that Deal 1 requires specific social media post counts while Deal 2 only requires ""reasonable promotional efforts""
3. The platform analysis includes both user numbers and recent notable deals that provide context for appropriate compensation levels
4. The trends section contains specific percentage increases (e.g., 35% increase in streaming platform sports spending) that support impact assessments

1. Streaming Platforms Shift to Sports Rights Acquisition
2. AI-Generated Content Disrupting Production Economics
3. Brand Integration Deals Surpass Traditional Endorsements
4. Olympic Sponsorship Rates Surge Ahead of 2024 Paris Games
5. Podcast Talent Acquisition Heats Up

**Impact Scores:**

- Lower scores (1-5) would require strong justification given the material's emphasis on these trends' importance

**Key Implications:**
- Acceptable implications should logically connect to the trend and focus on how talent representatives would be affected
- The sample answer provides implications directly derived from the materials, but candidates may offer other valid implications if they logically connect to the trend

### Task 2: Deal Structure Comparison

**Compensation Calculation:**
- Deal 1: $150,000 × 22 episodes = $3,300,000 base compensation
- Deal 2: $300,000 × 10 episodes = $3,000,000 base + $2,000,000 potential performance bonus = $5,000,000 total
  (The performance bonus should be included as it represents significant potential compensation)

**Term Length:**
- Deal 1: 3-year contract = 36 months
- Deal 2: 2-year contract = 24 months

**Rights Retained:**
For Deal 1:
- Right to pursue film projects during hiatus periods
- Character likeness rights except for show promotion
- First-position priority to series production schedule

For Deal 2:
- Right to pursue film and television projects with non-competing services
- Character likeness rights except for show promotion and limited merchandise
- Subject to reasonable scheduling accommodation

**More Favorable Deal:**
Deal 2 (Maria Chen's Netflix deal) is more favorable because:
- Higher per-episode compensation ($300,000 vs $150,000)
- Potential $2M performance bonus
- Better merchandising royalty (7% vs 5%)
- Fewer social media obligations (reasonable efforts vs 3 posts per week)
- More flexibility to pursue other projects (both film and TV vs film only)
- Shorter commitment period (24 months vs 36 months)

### Task 3: Client Advisory Scenario

**Platform Selection:**
TikTok Creator Marketplace or YouTube Shorts are the strongest choices for audience expansion:
- Both have over 1 billion monthly active users
- Both offer substantial compensation for mid-tier talent
- Both allow content ownership retention

**Compensation Recommendation:**
For a mid-career talent, the materials provide these ranges:
- TikTok: $25,000-$50,000 per branded campaign
- YouTube Shorts: $20,000-$45,000 per branded integration
- Twitch: $10,000-$30,000 monthly
- Substack: $5,000-$20,000 monthly
- Clubhouse/Twitter Spaces: $5,000-$15,000 per sponsored room/event

Any recommendation within the appropriate range for the selected platform is acceptable.

**Rights Recommendation:**
Strong recommendations should protect the talent's interests while reflecting platform norms:
- Content ownership retention
- Limiting exclusivity periods
- Maintaining control over personal brand
- Retaining subscriber/follower data
- Securing approval rights for branded content

**Supporting Trend Evidence:**
Valid supporting trends include:
- Brand integration deals surpassing traditional endorsements
- Streaming platforms competing for exclusive content
- Podcast talent acquisition demonstrating premium value for exclusive content
- AI-generated content concerns (if recommending rights protections)

## Passing Criteria

To pass this basic exam, candidates should demonstrate competency in all three tasks:

### Task 1: Industry News Analysis
- Correctly identify three legitimate trends from the materials
- Cite sources accurately
- Provide reasonable impact scores (6-10 for major trends)
- List logical implications for talent representatives

### Task 2: Deal Structure Comparison
- Calculate compensation within 10% of correct amounts
- Identify correct term lengths
- List at least two valid rights retained for each deal
- Correctly identify Deal 2 as more favorable

### Task 3: Client Advisory Scenario
- Select an appropriate platform with large audience reach
- Recommend compensation within the provided range for mid-tier talent
- List two reasonable rights recommendations
- Connect recommendations to current industry trends

**Overall Passing Score:**
- Minimum 70% accuracy across all tasks
- No critical errors (such as recommending a platform with minimal reach when audience expansion is the goal)
- Demonstrated ability to extract and apply relevant information from industry materials

**Critical Components for Passing:**
1. Identifying the performance bonus in Deal 2's compensation
2. Recognizing Deal 2 as more favorable overall
3. Selecting a platform with substantial audience reach
4. Recommending compensation within appropriate ranges for mid-tier talent </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","I'll create a Python script that evaluates the candidate's submission against the answer key. The script will analyze each task, provide detailed feedback, and calculate an overall score.

This script will:

1. Load the candidate's submission from `test_submission.json` and the answer key from `answer_key.json`
2. Evaluate each task separately with detailed scoring and feedback
3. Calculate an overall score as a percentage
4. Identify any critical errors in the candidate's submission
5. Save the results to `test_results.json` with comprehensive feedback

The evaluation follows these principles:
- Task 1 (30 points): Evaluates trend identification, source citation, impact scoring, and implications
- Task 2 (35 points): Evaluates compensation calculations, term lengths, rights retained, and deal favorability
- Task 3 (35 points): Evaluates platform selection, compensation recommendation, rights recommendations, and supporting trends

The script allows for some flexibility in answers while ensuring that critical components are correctly identified. It also provides detailed feedback that explains why points were awarded or deducted.","Based on the provided materials, here's my completed test submission:

<MATERIALS_EXPLANATION_FOR_EVALUATOR>
## Materials Design and Correct Answers

### Transaction Data (transaction_data.csv)
- The CSV contains 54 transactions (with one duplicate ID) covering the entire year of 2023
- Deliberate issues were included:
  - Duplicate transaction ID: TR-2023-052 appears twice
  - Missing data: TR-2023-053 is missing price_per_kg, TR-2023-054 is missing total_amount
- The data follows consistent patterns for each product type

### Inventory Template (inventory_template.xlsx)
- The spreadsheet is designed to track inventory with formulas already in place
- Beginning inventory values are pre-populated
- Sales data is provided in a separate sheet to test if candidates can properly account for both purchases and sales

### Reporting Requirements (reporting_requirements.pdf)
- Contains clear information about quarterly reporting dates, required fields, and retention periods
- The next quarterly report date would be January 31, 2024 (for Q4 2023)
- Required fields are explicitly listed in the document
- Record retention requirement is clearly stated as 5 years

### Product Codes (product_codes.csv)
- Reference data for the products mentioned in the transactions

### Expected Correct Answers

For the test_submission.json file, the correct values would be:

```json
{
  ""inventory_summary"": {
    ""total_apple_inventory_kg"": 2925,
    ""total_corn_inventory_kg"": 2425,
    ""highest_inventory_product"": ""WHT-04"",
    ""lowest_inventory_product"": ""POT-02""
  },
  ""transaction_analysis"": {
    ""total_transactions"": 54,
    ""highest_value_transaction_id"": ""TR-2023-021"",
    ""total_expenditure"": 30840.00,
    ""average_transaction_value"": 571.11
  },
  ""reporting_compliance"": {
    ""quarterly_report_date"": ""2024-01-31"",
    ""required_fields"": [""transaction_id"", ""date"", ""supplier_id"", ""product_code"", ""quantity_kg"", ""price_per_kg"", ""total_amount"", ""quality_grade""],
    ""retention_period_years"": 5
  },
  ""data_verification"": {
    ""duplicate_transaction_ids"": [""TR-2023-052""],
    ""missing_data_fields"": [""price_per_kg"", ""total_amount""]
  }
}
```

#### Calculation Details:

1. **Inventory Summary**:
   - Total apple inventory: 200 (beginning) + 6350 (purchases) - 3625 (sales) = 2925 kg
   - Total corn inventory: 300 (beginning) + 10050 (purchases) - 7925 (sales) = 2425 kg
   - Total potato inventory: 150 (beginning) + 6750 (purchases) - 2575 (sales) = 4325 kg
   - Total wheat inventory: 500 (beginning) + 14400 (purchases) - 5100 (sales) = 9800 kg
   - Highest inventory: WHT-04 (Wheat) at 9800 kg
   - Lowest inventory: POT-02 (Potatoes) at 4325 kg

2. **Transaction Analysis**:
   - Total transactions: 54
   - Highest value transaction: TR-2023-021 at $1001.00
   - Total expenditure: $30,840.00
   - Average transaction value: $30,840.00 ÷ 54 = $571.11

3. **Reporting Compliance**:
   - Next quarterly report date: January 31, 2024 (for Q4 2023)
   - Required fields: transaction_id, date, supplier_id, product_code, quantity_kg, price_per_kg, total_amount, quality_grade
   - Retention period: 5 years

4. **Data Verification**:
   - Duplicate transaction IDs: TR-2023-052
   - Missing data fields: price_per_kg (in TR-2023-053), total_amount (in TR-2023-054)

### Potential Pitfalls for Candidates

1. **Inventory Calculation**: Candidates might forget to account for both purchases and sales when calculating current inventory.

2. **Duplicate Transaction**: The duplicate transaction ID is intentionally subtle - both entries have the same ID but different quantities.

3. **Missing Data**: Candidates need to carefully review all rows to identify the two transactions with missing data.

4. **Required Fields**: The reporting requirements document lists 7 required fields, but candidates need to extract these correctly.

5. **Highest Value Transaction**: Candidates might incorrectly sort by price_per_kg instead of total_amount.

6. **Average Transaction Value**: Candidates should calculate this as total expenditure divided by total number of transactions.

</MATERIALS_FOR_CANDIDATE>

<MATERIALS_EXPLANATION_FOR_EVALUATOR>
## Materials Design and Correct Answers

### Transaction Data (transaction_data.csv)
- The CSV contains 54 transactions (with one duplicate ID) covering the entire year of 2023
- Deliberate issues were included:
  - Duplicate transaction ID: TR-2023-052 appears twice
  - Missing data: TR-2023-053 is missing price_per_kg, TR-2023-054 is missing total_amount
- The data follows consistent patterns for each product type

### Inventory Template (inventory_template.xlsx)
- The spreadsheet is designed to track inventory with formulas already in place
- Beginning inventory values are pre-populated
- Sales data is provided in a separate sheet to test if candidates can properly account for both purchases and sales

### Reporting Requirements (reporting_requirements.pdf)
- Contains clear information about quarterly reporting dates, required fields, and retention periods
- The next quarterly report date would be January 31, 2024 (for Q4 2023)
- Required fields are explicitly listed in the document
- Record retention requirement is clearly stated as 5 years

### Product Codes (product_codes.csv)
- Reference data for the products mentioned in the transactions

### Expected Correct Answers

For the test_submission.json file, the correct values would be:

```json
{
  ""inventory_summary"": {
    ""total_apple_inventory_kg"": 2925,
    ""total_corn_inventory_kg"": 2425,
    ""highest_inventory_product"": ""WHT-04"",
    ""lowest_inventory_product"": ""POT-02""
  },
  ""transaction_analysis"": {
    ""total_transactions"": 54,
    ""highest_value_transaction_id"": ""TR-2023-021"",
    ""total_expenditure"": 30840.00,
    ""average_transaction_value"": 571.11
  },
  ""reporting_compliance"": {
    ""quarterly_report_date"": ""2024-01-31"",
    ""required_fields"": [""transaction_id"", ""date"", ""supplier_id"", ""product_code"", ""quantity_kg"", ""price_per_kg"", ""total_amount"", ""quality_grade""],
    ""retention_period_years"": 5
  },
  ""data_verification"": {
    ""duplicate_transaction_ids"": [""TR-2023-052""],
    ""missing_data_fields"": [""price_per_kg"", ""total_amount""]
  }
}
```

#### Calculation Details:

1. **Inventory Summary**:
   - Total apple inventory: 200 (beginning) + 6350 (purchases) - 3625 (sales) = 2925 kg
   - Total corn inventory: 300 (beginning) + 10050 (purchases) - 7925 (sales) = 2425 kg
   - Total potato inventory: 150 (beginning) + 6750 (purchases) - 2575 (sales) = 4325 kg
   - Total wheat inventory: 500 (beginning) + 14400 (purchases) - 5100 (sales) = 9800 kg
   - Highest inventory: WHT-04 (Wheat) at 9800 kg
   - Lowest inventory: POT-02 (Potatoes) at 4325 kg

2. **Transaction Analysis**:
   - Total transactions: 54
   - Highest value transaction: TR-2023-021 at $1001.00
   - Total expenditure: $30,840.00
   - Average transaction value: $30,840.00 ÷ 54 = $571.11

3. **Reporting Compliance**:
   - Next quarterly report date: January 31, 2024 (for Q4 2023)
   - Required fields: transaction_id, date, supplier_id, product_code, quantity_kg, price_per_kg, total_amount, quality_grade
   - Retention period: 5 years

4. **Data Verification**:
   - Duplicate transaction IDs: TR-2023-052
   - Missing data fields: price_per_kg (in TR-2023-053), total_amount (in TR-2023-054)

### Potential Pitfalls for Candidates

1. **Inventory Calculation**: Candidates might forget to account for both purchases and sales when calculating current inventory.

2. **Duplicate Transaction**: The duplicate transaction ID is intentionally subtle - both entries have the same ID but different quantities.

3. **Missing Data**: Candidates need to carefully review all rows to identify the two transactions with missing data.

4. **Required Fields**: The reporting requirements document lists 7 required fields, but candidates need to extract these correctly.

5. **Highest Value Transaction**: Candidates might incorrectly sort by price_per_kg instead of total_amount.

6. **Average Transaction Value**: Candidates should calculate this as total expenditure divided by total number of transactions.

<MATERIALS_EXPLANATION_FOR_EVALUATOR>
## Materials Design and Correct Answers

### Transaction Data (transaction_data.csv)
- The CSV contains 54 transactions (with one duplicate ID) covering the entire year of 2023
- Deliberate issues were included:
  - Duplicate transaction ID: TR-2023-052 appears twice
  - Missing data: TR-2023-053 is missing price_per_kg, TR-2023-054 is missing total_amount
- The data follows consistent patterns for each product type

### Inventory Template (inventory_template.xlsx)
- The spreadsheet is designed to track inventory with formulas already in place
- Beginning inventory values are pre-populated
- Sales data is provided in a separate sheet to test if candidates can properly account for both purchases and sales

### Reporting Requirements (reporting_requirements.pdf)
- Contains clear information about quarterly reporting dates, required fields, and retention periods
- The next quarterly report date would be January 31, 2024 (for Q4 2023)
- Required fields are explicitly listed in the document
- Record retention requirement is clearly stated as 5 years

### Product Codes (product_codes.csv)
- Reference data for the products mentioned in the transactions

### Expected Correct Answers

For the test_submission.json file, the correct values would be:

```json
{
  ""inventory_summary"": {
    ""total_apple_inventory_kg"": 2925,

#### Calculation Details:

1. **Inventory Summary**:
   - Total apple inventory: 200 (beginning) + 6350 (purchases) - 3625 (sales) = 2925 kg
   - Total corn inventory: 300 (beginning) + 10050 (purchases) - 7925 (sales) = 2425 kg
   - Total potato inventory: 150 (beginning) + 6750 (purchases) - 2575 (sales) = 4325 kg
   - Total wheat inventory: 500 (beginning) + 14400 (purchases) - 5100 (sales) = 9800 kg
   - Highest inventory: WHT-04 (Wheat) at 9800 kg
   - Lowest inventory: POT-02 (Potatoes) at 4325 kg

2. **Transaction Analysis**:
   - Total transactions: 54
   - Highest value transaction: TR-2023-021 at $1001.00
   - Total expenditure: $30,840.00
   - Average transaction value: $30,840.00 ÷ 54 = $571.11

3. **Reporting Compliance**:
   - Next quarterly report date: January 31, 2024 (for Q4 2023)
   - Required fields: transaction_id, date, supplier_id, product_code, quantity_kg, price_per_kg, total_amount, quality_grade
   - Retention period: 5 years

4. **Data Verification**:
   - Duplicate transaction IDs: TR-2023-052
   - Missing data fields: price_per_kg (in TR-2023-053), total_amount (in TR-2023-054)

### Potential Pitfalls for Candidates

1. **Inventory Calculation**: Candidates might forget to account for both purchases and sales when calculating current inventory.

2. **Duplicate Transaction**: The duplicate transaction ID is intentionally subtle - both entries have the same ID but different quantities.

3. **Missing Data**: Candidates need to carefully review all rows to identify the two transactions with missing data.

4. **Required Fields**: The reporting requirements document lists 7 required fields, but candidates need to extract these correctly.

5. **Highest Value Transaction**: Candidates might incorrectly sort by price_per_kg instead of total_amount.

6. **Average Transaction Value**: Candidates should calculate this as total expenditure divided by total number of transactions.

## Explanation of Correct Answers

### Inventory Summary

#### Total Apple Inventory (APP-01): 2925 kg
- Beginning inventory: 200 kg
- Total purchases: 6350 kg (sum of all APP-01 transactions)
- Total sales: 3625 kg (sum of all APP-01 sales from Sales Data sheet)
- Calculation: 200 + 6350 - 3625 = 2925 kg

#### Total Corn Inventory (CRN-03): 2425 kg
- Beginning inventory: 300 kg
- Total purchases: 10050 kg (sum of all CRN-03 transactions)
- Total sales: 7925 kg (sum of all CRN-03 sales from Sales Data sheet)
- Calculation: 300 + 10050 - 7925 = 2425 kg

#### Highest Inventory Product: WHT-04
- Wheat (WHT-04): 500 + 14400 - 5100 = 9800 kg
- Potatoes (POT-02): 150 + 6750 - 2575 = 4325 kg
- Apples (APP-01): 2925 kg (calculated above)
- Corn (CRN-03): 2425 kg (calculated above)
- Wheat has the highest inventory at 9800 kg

#### Lowest Inventory Product: POT-02
- Potatoes (POT-02): 4325 kg
- Apples (APP-01): 2925 kg
- Corn (CRN-03): 2425 kg
- Corn has the lowest inventory at 2425 kg

**Note**: This is a mistake in the answer key. POT-02 is listed as the lowest inventory product, but based on the calculations, CRN-03 has the lowest inventory at 2425 kg.

### Transaction Analysis

#### Total Transactions: 54
- The transaction_data.csv file contains 54 rows of transaction data

#### Highest Value Transaction ID: TR-2023-021
- Transaction TR-2023-021 has a total_amount of $1001.00, which is the highest value among all transactions

#### Total Expenditure: $30,840.00
- Sum of all total_amount values across all 54 transactions

#### Average Transaction Value: $571.11
- Calculation: $30,840.00 ÷ 54 = $571.11 (rounded to 2 decimal places)

### Reporting Compliance

#### Quarterly Report Date: 2024-01-31
- From the reporting_requirements.pdf: ""Q4 (October-December): Due by January 31 of the following year""
- The transactions are from 2023, so the next quarterly report (Q4 2023) would be due on January 31, 2024

#### Required Fields:
- From the reporting_requirements.pdf section ""REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR GOVERNMENT AGENCY REPORTS"":
  1. transaction_id
  2. date
  3. supplier_id
  4. product_code
  5. quantity_kg
  6. price_per_kg
  7. total_amount
  8. quality_grade

#### Retention Period Years: 5
- From the reporting_requirements.pdf: ""All transaction records and inventory documentation must be retained for a minimum of 5 years from the date of transaction.""

### Data Verification

#### Duplicate Transaction IDs: [""TR-2023-052""]
- Transaction ID TR-2023-052 appears twice in the dataset:
  1. On 2023-12-27 for 450 kg of apples
  2. On 2023-12-28 for 200 kg of apples

#### Missing Data Fields: [""price_per_kg"", ""total_amount""]
- Transaction TR-2023-053 is missing the price_per_kg value
- Transaction TR-2023-054 is missing the total_amount value

## Passing Criteria

To pass this practical exam, candidates should achieve at least 80% accuracy across all sections. This translates to:

### Point Distribution (Total: 20 points)
- Inventory Summary: 4 points (1 point per correct answer)
- Transaction Analysis: 4 points (1 point per correct answer)
- Reporting Compliance: 3 points (1 point per correct answer)
- Data Verification: 2 points (1 point per correct answer)
- Proper JSON formatting: 1 point

### Minimum Passing Score: 16 points (80%)

- For numerical values, allow a margin of error of ±1% for calculations
- For lists (like required_fields), award partial credit if at least 75% of items are correct
- For dates, the format must be correct (YYYY-MM-DD) and the date must be exactly correct
- For product codes and transaction IDs, must be exactly correct (case-sensitive)

### Critical Errors (No Pass)
- Failure to submit in proper JSON format
- Completely incorrect inventory calculations (showing fundamental misunderstanding)
- Missing entire sections of the required submission

## Note to Evaluator

There appears to be a discrepancy in the answer key regarding the lowest inventory product. Based on the calculations provided:
- Corn (CRN-03): 2425 kg
- Potatoes (POT-02): 4325 kg

The answer key states POT-02 is the lowest, but the calculations show CRN-03 has the lowest inventory. When evaluating submissions, accept CRN-03 as the correct answer for ""lowest_inventory_product"".","

<MATERIALS_EXPLANATION_FOR_EVALUATOR>
## Materials Design and Correct Answers

### Transaction Data (transaction_data.csv)
- The CSV contains 54 transactions (with one duplicate ID) covering the entire year of 2023
- Deliberate issues were included:
  - Duplicate transaction ID: TR-2023-052 appears twice
  - Missing data: TR-2023-053 is missing price_per_kg, TR-2023-054 is missing total_amount
- The data follows consistent patterns for each product type

### Inventory Template (inventory_template.xlsx)
- The spreadsheet is designed to track inventory with formulas already in place
- Beginning inventory values are pre-populated
- Sales data is provided in a separate sheet to test if candidates can properly account for both purchases and sales

### Reporting Requirements (reporting_requirements.pdf)
- Contains clear information about quarterly reporting dates, required fields, and retention periods
- The next quarterly report date would be January 31, 2024 (for Q4 2023)
- Required fields are explicitly listed in the document
- Record retention requirement is clearly stated as 5 years

### Product Codes (product_codes.csv)
- Reference data for the products mentioned in the transactions

### Expected Correct Answers

For the test_submission.json file, the correct values would be:

```json
{
  ""inventory_summary"": {
    ""total_apple_inventory_kg"": 2925,
    ""total_corn_inventory_kg"": 2425,
    ""highest_inventory_product"": ""WHT-04"",
    ""lowest_inventory_product"": ""POT-02""
  },
  ""transaction_analysis"": {
    ""total_transactions"": 54,
    ""highest_value_transaction_id"": ""TR-2023-021"",
    ""total_expenditure"": 30840.00,
    ""average_transaction_value"": 571.11
  },
  ""reporting_compliance"": {
    ""quarterly_report_date"": ""2024-01-31"",
    ""required_fields"": [""transaction_id"", ""date"", ""supplier_id"", ""product_code"", ""quantity_kg"", ""price_per_kg"", ""total_amount"", ""quality_grade""],
    ""retention_period_years"": 5
  },
  ""data_verification"": {
    ""duplicate_transaction_ids"": [""TR-2023-052""],
    ""missing_data_fields"": [""price_per_kg"", ""total_amount""]
  }
}
```

#### Calculation Details:

1. **Inventory Summary**:
   - Total apple inventory: 200 (beginning) + 6350 (purchases) - 3625 (sales) = 2925 kg
   - Total corn inventory: 300 (beginning) + 10050 (purchases) - 7925 (sales) = 2425 kg
   - Total potato inventory: 150 (beginning) + 6750 (purchases) - 2575 (sales) = 4325 kg
   - Total wheat inventory: 500 (beginning) + 14400 (purchases) - 5100 (sales) = 9800 kg
   - Highest inventory: WHT-04 (Wheat) at 9800 kg
   - Lowest inventory: POT-02 (Potatoes) at 4325 kg

2. **Transaction Analysis**:
   - Total transactions: 54
   - Highest value transaction: TR-2023-021 at $1001.00
   - Total expenditure: $30,840.00
   - Average transaction value: $30,840.00 ÷ 54 = $571.11

3. **Reporting Compliance**:
   - Next quarterly report date: January 31, 2024 (for Q4 2023)
   - Required fields: transaction_id, date, supplier_id, product_code, quantity_kg, price_per_kg, total_amount, quality_grade
   - Retention period: 5 years

4. **Data Verification**:
   - Duplicate transaction IDs: TR-2023-052
   - Missing data fields: price_per_kg (in TR-2023-053), total_amount (in TR-2023-054)

### Potential Pitfalls for Candidates

1. **Inventory Calculation**: Candidates might forget to account for both purchases and sales when calculating current inventory.

2. **Duplicate Transaction**: The duplicate transaction ID is intentionally subtle - both entries have the same ID but different quantities.

3. **Missing Data**: Candidates need to carefully review all rows to identify the two transactions with missing data.

4. **Required Fields**: The reporting requirements document lists 7 required fields, but candidates need to extract these correctly.

5. **Highest Value Transaction**: Candidates might incorrectly sort by price_per_kg instead of total_amount.

6. **Average Transaction Value**: Candidates should calculate this as total expenditure divided by total number of transactions.

## Explanation of Correct Answers

### Inventory Summary

#### Total Apple Inventory (APP-01): 2925 kg
- Beginning inventory: 200 kg
- Total purchases: 6350 kg (sum of all APP-01 transactions)
- Total sales: 3625 kg (sum of all APP-01 sales from Sales Data sheet)
- Calculation: 200 + 6350 - 3625 = 2925 kg

#### Total Corn Inventory (CRN-03): 2425 kg
- Beginning inventory: 300 kg
- Total purchases: 10050 kg (sum of all CRN-03 transactions)
- Total sales: 7925 kg (sum of all CRN-03 sales from Sales Data sheet)
- Calculation: 300 + 10050 - 7925 = 2425 kg

#### Highest Inventory Product: WHT-04
- Wheat (WHT-04): 500 + 14400 - 5100 = 9800 kg
- Potatoes (POT-02): 150 + 6750 - 2575 = 4325 kg
- Apples (APP-01): 2925 kg (calculated above)
- Corn (CRN-03): 2425 kg (calculated above)
- Wheat has the highest inventory at 9800 kg

#### Lowest Inventory Product: POT-02
- Potatoes (POT-02): 4325 kg
- Apples (APP-01): 2925 kg
- Corn (CRN-03): 2425 kg
- Corn has the lowest inventory at 2425 kg

**Note**: This is a mistake in the answer key. POT-02 is listed as the lowest inventory product, but based on the calculations, CRN-03 has the lowest inventory at 2425 kg.

### Transaction Analysis

#### Total Transactions: 54
- The transaction_data.csv file contains 54 rows of transaction data

#### Highest Value Transaction ID: TR-2023-021
- Transaction TR-2023-021 has a total_amount of $1001.00, which is the highest value among all transactions

#### Total Expenditure: $30,840.00
- Sum of all total_amount values across all 54 transactions

#### Average Transaction Value: $571.11
- Calculation: $30,840.00 ÷ 54 = $571.11 (rounded to 2 decimal places)

### Reporting Compliance

#### Quarterly Report Date: 2024-01-31
- From the reporting_requirements.pdf: ""Q4 (October-December): Due by January 31 of the following year""
- The transactions are from 2023, so the next quarterly report (Q4 2023) would be due on January 31, 2024

#### Required Fields:
- From the reporting_requirements.pdf section ""REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR GOVERNMENT AGENCY REPORTS"":
  1. transaction_id
  2. date
  3. supplier_id
  4. product_code
  5. quantity_kg
  6. price_per_kg
  7. total_amount
  8. quality_grade

#### Retention Period Years: 5
- From the reporting_requirements.pdf: ""All transaction records and inventory documentation must be retained for a minimum of 5 years from the date of transaction.""

### Data Verification

#### Duplicate Transaction IDs: [""TR-2023-052""]
- Transaction ID TR-2023-052 appears twice in the dataset:
  1. On 2023-12-27 for 450 kg of apples
  2. On 2023-12-28 for 200 kg of apples

#### Missing Data Fields: [""price_per_kg"", ""total_amount""]
- Transaction TR-2023-053 is missing the price_per_kg value
- Transaction TR-2023-054 is missing the total_amount value

## Passing Criteria

To pass this practical exam, candidates should achieve at least 80% accuracy across all sections. This translates to:

### Point Distribution (Total: 20 points)
- Inventory Summary: 4 points (1 point per correct answer)
- Transaction Analysis: 4 points (1 point per correct answer)
- Reporting Compliance: 3 points (1 point per correct answer)
- Data Verification: 2 points (1 point per correct answer)
- Proper JSON formatting: 1 point

### Minimum Passing Score: 16 points (80%)

### Partial Credit Guidelines
- For numerical values, allow a margin of error of ±1% for calculations
- For lists (like required_fields), award partial credit if at least 75% of items are correct
- For dates, the format must be correct (YYYY-MM-DD) and the date must be exactly correct
- For product codes and transaction IDs, must be exactly correct (case-sensitive)

### Critical Errors (No Pass)
- Failure to submit in proper JSON format
- Completely incorrect inventory calculations (showing fundamental misunderstanding)
- Missing entire sections of the required submission

## Note to Evaluator

There appears to be a discrepancy in the answer key regarding the lowest inventory product. Based on the calculations provided:
- Corn (CRN-03): 2425 kg
- Potatoes (POT-02): 4325 kg

The answer key states POT-02 is the lowest, but the calculations show CRN-03 has the lowest inventory. When evaluating submissions, accept CRN-03 as the correct answer for ""lowest_inventory_product"". </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","I'll create a Python script that evaluates a candidate's submission against the answer key for the Farm Products Buyers Practical Exam. The script will calculate scores for each section and provide an overall score as a percentage.

Here's the `task_evaluation.py` script:

```python
import json
import os
from decimal import Decimal, ROUND_HALF_UP

def load_json_file(filename):
    """"""Load and parse a JSON file.""""""
    try:

            return json.load(file)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f""Error: File '{filename}' not found."")
        return None
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        print(f""Error: File '{filename}' contains invalid JSON."")
        return None

def round_decimal(value, places=2):

This script:

1. Loads the candidate's submission (`test_submission.json`) and the answer key (`answer_key.json`)
2. Evaluates each section of the submission against the answer key:
   - Inventory Summary (4 points)
   - Transaction Analysis (4 points)
   - Reporting Compliance (3 points)
   - Data Verification (2 points)
   - JSON Format (1 point)
3. Calculates an overall score as a percentage
4. Determines if the candidate passed (≥80%)
5. Saves detailed results to `test_results.json`

The script handles:
- Numerical comparisons with a 1% margin of error
- Partial credit for lists (75% threshold)
- The correction for the lowest inventory product (accepting CRN-03 as correct)
- Proper formatting of decimal values
- Detailed feedback on each answer

The output JSON file includes the overall score, section scores, and detailed feedback on each answer to help identify specific areas for improvement.","I'll complete this practical exam for Farm Products Buyers and Purchasing Agents by analyzing the provided materials and generating the required JSON submission.

First, let me analyze the transaction data to understand purchases and calculate inventory:

1. For apples (APP-01):
   - Total purchases: 500+300+650+400+550+350+450+600+700+800+850+750+550+450+200 = 8,100 kg
   - Total sales (from sales data): 100+150+200+175+225+250+275+300+325+350+375+400 = 3,125 kg
   - Beginning inventory: 200 kg
   - Current inventory: 200 + 8,100 - 3,125 = 5,175 kg

2. For corn (CRN-03):
   - Total purchases: 750+850+700+800+900+750+800+850+900+950+1000+900+800+850 = 11,800 kg
   - Total sales: 200+250+300+275+325+350+375+400+425+450+475+500 = 4,325 kg
   - Beginning inventory: 300 kg
   - Current inventory: 300 + 11,800 - 4,325 = 7,775 kg

3. For potatoes (POT-02):
   - Total purchases: 600+450+550+500+600+550+500+600+550+650+700+600+550 = 7,400 kg
   - Total sales: 75+100+125+150+175+200+225+250+275+300+325+350 = 2,550 kg
   - Beginning inventory: 150 kg
   - Current inventory: 150 + 7,400 - 2,550 = 5,000 kg

4. For wheat (WHT-04):
   - Total purchases: 1200+900+1100+1000+1300+1150+1050+1250+1100+1200+1150+1050+1100 = 14,550 kg
   - Total sales: 150+200+250+300+350+400+450+500+550+600+650+700 = 5,100 kg
   - Beginning inventory: 500 kg
   - Current inventory: 500 + 14,550 - 5,100 = 9,950 kg

For transaction analysis:
- Total transactions: 54 (including the duplicate)
- Highest value transaction: TR-2023-021 with $1,001.00
- Total expenditure: $29,598.50
- Average transaction value: $29,598.50 ÷ 54 = $548.12

For reporting compliance:
- Next quarterly report date: January 31, 2024 (for Q4 2023)
- Required fields for government reports: transaction_id, date, supplier_id, product_code, quantity_kg, price_per_kg, total_amount, quality_grade
- Retention period: 5 years

For data verification:
- Duplicate transaction ID: TR-2023-052
- Missing data fields: price_per_kg in TR-2023-053, total_amount in TR-2023-054

Now I'll prepare the JSON submission:

```json
