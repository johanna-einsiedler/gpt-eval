Bodily Injury and Property Damage liability coverage would apply to claims made by Sarah Johnson and Robert Martinez. Medical Payments coverage may apply to the insured's medical expenses. The key coverage issue will be determining liability percentages among the parties, as this will affect how the policy limits are allocated. There are no apparent policy exclusions that would bar coverage, though the limits may be insufficient for the severe injuries sustained by Robert Martinez."

        "liability_rationale": "Based on the conflicting evidence, it appears both drivers share responsibility for the accident. The insured may have failed to properly observe the traffic signal (per police report and witness James Taylor), while Sarah Johnson admitted to accelerating to make a yellow light and was traveling above the speed limit. The delivery truck's obstruction of visibility contributes to the accident as a proximate cause. The pedestrian bears no liability as he had the walk signal. Applying comparative negligence principles, I assign 40% liability to the insured for potential failure to observe traffic signal and maintain proper lookout, 50% to Sarah Johnson for speeding and attempting to beat the light, and 10% to QuickShip Delivery for creating a hazardous visibility condition by parking where they did."
