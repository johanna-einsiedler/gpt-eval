        "reasonable_price": 1465.0,
        "price_trend_analysis": "The historical pricing data shows a consistent upward trend over the past 3 years, with quarterly increases averaging 1.5%. Key factors driving price increases include material cost increases (Q2 2020, Q2 2021), energy costs (Q2 2022), and general inflation (Q1 2021, Q1 2022, Q1 2023). The market index has risen from 100 to 130 (30% increase) while prices have increased from $1250 to $1480 (18.4% increase). Prices typically peak in Q3 (summer demand) and see slight corrections in Q4. For 50 units (similar to Q3 2022 volume), a price slightly below the current $1480 is reasonable given the recent market stabilization.",
        "recommendation": "Recommend purchasing at $1465/unit, representing a 1% discount from current prices while accounting for the bulk purchase of 50 units. This price reflects the recent market stabilization while maintaining a fair margin for the supplier. Suggest negotiating a price ceiling agreement for future purchases to hedge against inflation."

While Furniture Plus has slightly better quality and warranty, their higher price and longer payment terms reduce their attractiveness. Premium Furnishings is overpriced for marginal quality improvement, while Budget Office Supply's lower quality and warranty make them less desirable despite the lowest price.",
