For streaming royalties, I first calculated the platform fee of 15% ($1,875) per clause 3.2, subtracted it from the gross payment to get $10,625, then applied the 10% commission rate from clause 3.1 to arrive at $1,062.50.

For the TV Commercial overpayment, I would immediately notify the client of the $5,000 excess payment, document the discrepancy, and either refund the difference or apply it to future services with proper documentation and client approval.

I've assigned high priority to all deposits, with the most imminent being City Lights (due June 25), followed by FilmVision Gala (August 15) and Brand Ambassador (September 10). For each deposit, I'll send reminder emails 14 days before the due date and follow up 7 days before if unpaid. For main payments, I've scheduled reminders at 21, 14, and 7 days before due dates. The strategy includes weekly status reviews and maintaining a tracking spreadsheet with payment status, contact history, and follow-up actions. For projects without deposits (The Dark Corner, Voice of Tomorrow), I'll implement earlier payment reminders starting 30 days before due dates. This approach ensures we maintain positive client relationships while securing timely payments, with special attention to the highest value projects (City Lights at $75,000 and Brand Ambassador at $50,000) to maximize cash flow."

The Summer Festival payment (MM-2304-01) was received 2 days late but in full, with the correct 12.5% commission rate applied. For the Streaming Royalties (MM-2304-02), the payment reflects the 15% platform fee deduction, resulting in $7,225 received instead of $8,500. The commission was correctly calculated at 10% of the net amount after platform fees. The Sports Brand Deal (MM-2305-01) was paid in full but 5 days late. I applied the tiered commission structure: 20% on the first $50,000 and 15% on the remaining $15,000, totaling $12,250. The Private Performance payment (MM-2305-02) was significantly late (11 days) but paid in full with the correct 15% commission. The Music Video Cameo payment (MM-2306-01) shows a $2,000 shortfall that requires immediate follow-up. I recommend contacting the client to determine the reason for the partial payment and requesting the remaining $2,000. Additionally, I suggest implementing a late fee policy for future payments, as three of the five payments were received after their due dates."
