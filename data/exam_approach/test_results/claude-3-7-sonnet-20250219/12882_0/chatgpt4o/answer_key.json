            "ST008": "Strawberries require immediate purchasing attention due to several critical factors. Current inventory (280kg) will be depleted within 5 days against upcoming orders totaling 1230kg, creating a 950kg shortage. With the shortest shelf life (14 days) among all products and a brief 2-day lead time, immediate action is essential. Being in peak season (April-June), we can secure optimal pricing while avoiding the 40% off-season price increase. The 1000kg purchase recommendation meets the minimum order quantity while providing sufficient buffer above the immediate shortage. With the highest profit margin (50%) of all products, strawberries represent both an urgent need and significant profit opportunity. The recommended purchase quantity balances immediate demand with storage limitations and shelf life constraints.",
            "LT011": "Iceberg Lettuce requires immediate purchasing attention due to its extremely short shelf life (10 days) and rapid inventory depletion rate. Current inventory of 180kg against upcoming orders of 650kg creates a critical shortage of 470kg. With only a 2-day lead time but inventory projected to deplete within 6 days, immediate ordering is essential. The recommended purchase of 500kg exceeds the minimum order quantity (150kg) while providing a small buffer above immediate needs. Currently in season (March-November), we can avoid the 25% off-season price premium. With a strong profit margin of 43%, lettuce represents a profitable purchase. The relatively small order size (500kg) minimizes storage impact while ensuring we meet customer commitments. This purchase quantity balances immediate demand with the extremely short shelf life, preventing waste while meeting all confirmed orders.",
            "BN007": "Green Beans require immediate purchasing attention due to their short shelf life (21 days) and significant inventory shortage. Current inventory of 750kg against upcoming orders of 2050kg creates a 1300kg deficit. With inventory projected to deplete within 8 days against a 3-day lead time, prompt ordering is necessary. The recommended purchase of 1500kg meets the minimum order quantity (300kg) while providing sufficient coverage for all confirmed orders. Being in peak season (May-September), we can secure optimal pricing while avoiding the 25% off-season price increase. With a high profit margin (48%), green beans represent a significant profit opportunity. The purchase quantity exactly meets the supplier's discount threshold (1500kg), maximizing cost efficiency. This balanced approach ensures we meet all customer commitments while optimizing for seasonality, profit margin, and storage constraints."

            "ST008": "Strawberry purchases should be maximized during current peak season (April-June) due to 40% price increase during off-season. The recommended 1000kg purchase balances immediate needs with the short 14-day shelf life. Consider increasing order frequency rather than order size due to perishability constraints.",
            "TM009": "Roma Tomatoes are currently in peak season (June-September), making this an optimal purchasing window. The recommended 2500kg purchase exceeds the minimum order quantity while providing a 380kg buffer above immediate shortage. This slightly larger order takes advantage of seasonal pricing before the 30% off-season increase applies."
