        "visualization_insights": "Campaign B shows a higher mean sales amount (260.85) compared to Campaign A (215.48), indicating potentially better overall performance. However, Campaign B also displays greater variability (std dev: 134.01 vs 75.91), suggesting less consistent results. Campaign B's distribution is positively skewed with notable outliers at the high end, while Campaign A shows a more symmetric distribution. The higher median for Campaign B (230.80 vs 210.35) confirms its general superiority in sales performance across the distribution, not just due to outliers."

Campaign B generated significantly higher sales on average, with the 95% confidence interval indicating that Campaign B outperforms Campaign A by between $1.22 and $89.52 per sale.

This suggests that geographic location alone does not strongly influence sales performance. However, when examining campaign effectiveness within each region, Campaign B consistently outperforms Campaign A across all regions, with the largest difference observed in the South region."

This indicates that higher customer satisfaction is strongly associated with higher sales amounts. This relationship suggests that improving customer experience could directly translate to increased sales performance."

Despite having greater variability, Campaign B consistently outperformed Campaign A across most demographic segments, particularly with high-income customers and middle-aged segments.",
        "regional_insights": "While regional differences alone were not statistically significant, Campaign B outperformed Campaign A in all regions. The South region showed the largest performance gap between campaigns, with Campaign B generating 32% higher average sales.

            "Implement customer satisfaction improvement initiatives as the strong correlation with sales suggests direct revenue benefits",
