        },
        "visualization_insights": "Campaign B shows a wider distribution with higher variability compared to Campaign A. While Campaign B has a higher mean and median, it also contains both lower minimums and higher maximums than Campaign A. The distribution of Campaign B appears right-skewed due to the outliers, while Campaign A shows a more symmetric distribution. Both campaigns show multimodal patterns corresponding to different income levels, with high-income customers generating consistently higher sales across both campaigns."

Campaign B generated significantly higher sales on average, with approximately $41 more per customer. The confidence interval indicates we can be 95% confident that the true difference in means falls between $1.23 and $80.81."

Campaign B outperformed Campaign A most dramatically in the South and West regions, while differences were smaller in the North and East regions. This suggests regional factors influence campaign effectiveness."

Higher satisfaction scores consistently correspond with higher sales values. This relationship holds across both campaigns, though Campaign B shows slightly higher satisfaction scores for comparable sales levels."

Despite greater variability and some very low values, Campaign B produced substantially higher maximum sales and better performance across most customer segments, particularly among high-income customers.",
        "regional_insights": "Campaign effectiveness varied significantly by region. The South and West regions showed the largest differences between campaigns, with Campaign B substantially outperforming Campaign A. The North and East regions showed smaller differences. This suggests regional market factors or demographic compositions influence campaign effectiveness.",
        "demographic_insights": "Income level was the strongest demographic predictor of sales performance, with high-income customers generating substantially higher sales in both campaigns. Campaign B was particularly effective with high-income customers. Middle-aged groups (35-54) responded better to both campaigns than younger or older customers.",

            "Prioritize Campaign B for future marketing efforts, especially targeting high-income customers",
            "Focus Campaign B resources particularly in the South and West regions where it showed the strongest performance advantage",
            "Target middle-aged demographic groups (35-54) for highest returns on marketing investment",
            "Investigate factors contributing to higher customer satisfaction as it strongly correlates with increased sales",
            "Consider a modified approach for low-income segments where Campaign B showed less advantage or even underperformed Campaign A"
