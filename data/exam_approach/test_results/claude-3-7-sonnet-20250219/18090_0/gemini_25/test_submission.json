The system helps nurses by providing up-to-date patient data, alerting them to critical changes or abnormal readings based on pre-set hospital guidelines, and allowing for quicker responses to potential patient deterioration.

Conversely, a 30-second interval for a stable patient's routine temperature check might be unnecessary and contribute to alarm fatigue if minor fluctuations trigger alerts. This variability needs careful management and clear guidelines for nurses or those configuring it.",
                "possibleSolution": "Develop evidence-based default polling frequencies based on unit type (ICU vs. Med/Surg) and patient condition. Provide clear guidelines for when and by whom these frequencies can be adjusted. The system should ideally allow for parameter-specific polling frequencies."

                "nursingImpact": "A rigid escalation pathway could delay necessary interventions if, for instance, the primary nurse is in another emergency or the charge nurse is unavailable. It doesn't account for team nursing models or situations where a peer might be better positioned to respond quickly, potentially impacting patient safety.",
                "possibleSolution": "Allow for more flexible or configurable escalation pathways. For instance, allow simultaneous notification to primary nurse and a 'buddy' nurse, or allow primary nurse to directly trigger RRT. Consider different pathways based on alert criticality and unit-specific workflows. The system should also clearly indicate who has acknowledged an alert."

            {
                "issue": "The technical specification states 'Data latency must not exceed 5 seconds from capture to display.' While 5 seconds is generally good, in highly critical situations (e.g., arrhythmia detection via CardioTech ECG-7), even a 5-second delay could be significant. The impact of 'three-tier validation' on this latency isn't fully clear.",
                "nursingImpact": "For life-threatening events like ventricular fibrillation detected by ECG, a 5-second delay in the information reaching the nurse (plus their reaction time) could critically impact patient outcomes. Nurses rely on truly real-time data for such critical parameters.",
                "possibleSolution": "Clarify if the 5-second latency is a worst-case scenario and if it applies uniformly to all vital signs, including critical ECG data. For parameters like continuous ECG, strive for near-instantaneous display for waveforms and critical arrhythmia alerts. Test and validate latency under peak load conditions to ensure it meets clinical needs, especially in ICU settings."
