It connects directly to bedside monitoring equipment to continuously track vital measurements including blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels, and temperature. The system alerts nurses when measurements fall outside safe ranges, allowing for faster intervention. It integrates with the hospital's electronic health record, eliminating the need for manual documentation of routine vital signs. This technology aims to enhance patient safety, improve documentation accuracy, and allow nurses to focus more on direct patient care rather than manual data collection and transcription.",
