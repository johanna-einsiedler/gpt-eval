                "issue": "The polling frequency is configurable from 30 seconds to 15 minutes. A 15-minute interval may be too infrequent for critically ill patients, potentially delaying the detection of significant changes in vital signs.",
                "nursingImpact": "Delayed detection of critical changes in vital signs could lead to delayed interventions and adverse patient outcomes, especially in unstable patients.",
                "possibleSolution": "Implement a dynamic polling frequency that automatically adjusts based on the patient's acuity level. For example, increase the polling frequency for patients in the ICU or those with unstable vital signs."
            },
            {
                "issue": "The default alert parameters may not be appropriate for all patient populations (e.g., elderly patients, patients with chronic conditions).",
                "nursingImpact": "Inappropriate alert parameters could lead to alert fatigue, where nurses become desensitized to alerts and may miss critical events. It could also lead to unnecessary interventions for patients with baseline vital signs outside the default ranges.",
                "possibleSolution": "Allow for customization of alert parameters based on individual patient needs and clinical judgment. Provide nurses with the ability to adjust the thresholds for specific vital signs based on the patient's medical history and current condition."

            {
                "issue": "The system relies on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi for data transmission. Connectivity issues could interrupt data flow and compromise the accuracy of vital signs monitoring.",
                "nursingImpact": "Loss of connectivity could result in gaps in vital signs data, leading to inaccurate assessments and delayed interventions. Nurses may need to revert to manual vital signs monitoring, increasing their workload and the risk of errors.",
                "possibleSolution": "Implement redundant communication pathways (e.g., cellular backup) to ensure continuous data transmission. Provide clear visual indicators to alert nurses to any connectivity issues and offer troubleshooting guidance."
