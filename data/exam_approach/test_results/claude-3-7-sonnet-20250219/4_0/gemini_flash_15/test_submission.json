    "pricing_strategy_rationale": "This pricing strategy prioritizes a minimum 40% profit margin while maintaining competitiveness.  The tiered pricing structure incentivizes higher volume purchases, reflecting the sales volume history.  Discounts are offered to mid-market and enterprise customers based on their higher purchase volumes and lower price sensitivity, while small businesses, being more price-sensitive, receive no discount at the base tier.  The competitive price index shows our prices are slightly below the industry average for all products, offering a competitive advantage.  The prices are set to ensure that even with the discounts, the 40% margin is maintained.  Future adjustments may be needed based on market response and competitor actions."
