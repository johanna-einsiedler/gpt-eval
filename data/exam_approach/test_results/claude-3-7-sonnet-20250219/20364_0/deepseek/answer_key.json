This room is your principal place of business. You have two options for calculating this deduction. The Simplified Method allows you to deduct $5 per square foot of your home used for business, up to 300 square feet. With your 300 sq ft office, this would give you a $1,500 deduction. Alternatively, the Regular Method calculates the business percentage of your home (300 sq ft ÷ 1,500 sq ft = 20%) and applies this to eligible expenses like mortgage/rent, utilities, insurance, and repairs. The Simplified Method is easier but the Regular Method might yield a larger deduction if your home expenses are significant. You'll need to maintain records of your home expenses if using the Regular Method.",

However, you should be aware that you'll be subject to Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) starting at age 73. These are mandatory withdrawals the IRS requires you to take annually from your traditional IRA. The amount is calculated based on your account balance and life expectancy. If you don't take your RMD when required, you could face a significant tax penalty of 25% on the amount not distributed. Your current $15,000 withdrawal may satisfy your RMD requirement when you reach that age, but you'll need to calculate the specific amount each year.",

This means you're eligible for the full credit amount of $4,000 ($2,000 per child). Up to $1,600 per child can be refundable through the Additional Child Tax Credit if the regular Child Tax Credit exceeds your tax liability.

The good news is that you won't be double-taxed on the same income. California provides a tax credit for taxes paid to other states.
