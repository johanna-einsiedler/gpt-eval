        "justification": "The project has a positive NPV of $11,854.73 and a BCR of 1.02, indicating it creates value but with a slim margin. The IRR of 5.12% exceeds the discount rate of 4.5%, confirming viability. However, the long payback period of 4 years 5 months and the minimal BCR suggest moderate financial risk, warranting approval with minor concerns."

While Option C has the lowest present value cost at $4,567,500, its debt service coverage ratio is the worst at 0.55. The project requires either increased revenue generation, reduced scope, or alternative financing structures to proceed responsibly."
