        "justification": "The project shows positive NPV and IRR above the discount rate, indicating financial viability. The BCR of 1.17 suggests benefits outweigh costs. The payback period of 4 years 3 months is reasonable for an IT project. Minor concerns exist regarding the initial investment size and annual cost increases, but overall the project is recommended for approval."

The project may need revised financing terms or additional revenue sources to be viable. Alternative financing options should be explored."
