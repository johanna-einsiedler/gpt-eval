The BCR (1.01) is marginally favorable, and the payback period (4 years, 5 months) is within the project life. While financially acceptable, the returns are modest, warranting minor concerns regarding potential variations in costs or benefits."

The calculated DSCRs are 0.71 (A), 0.78 (B), and 0.55 (C), indicating insufficient projected net revenue to safely cover the annual debt payments. Therefore, none of these options can be recommended as presented."
