        "justification": "The project shows a positive but modest NPV of $30,489.12 and an IRR of 5.91%, which is slightly above the discount rate of 4.5%. The benefit-cost ratio of 1.02 indicates the project barely exceeds the break-even point. With a payback period of 4 years and 5 months, the project recovers costs within its useful life but takes significant time."

The available annual revenue of $230,000 is insufficient to cover debt service requirements for any option. The project requires either increased revenue, reduced project costs, or alternative financing structures before proceeding."
