        "body": "Hi Maria,\n\nThank you for forwarding Mr. Michael Thompson’s file. After full review, the application has been approved with a Rated A classification, resulting in a +25 % premium adjustment over Standard rates. The decision is based on guideline UW-LI-5.3.27 (Diabetes Risk Assessment) and premium adjustments per Table 7.2.\n\nKey underwriting findings:\n• Type 2 Diabetes diagnosed 6 years ago at age 45 (falls within the 40-50 bracket for Rated A).  \n• Recent HbA1c 7.4 % (within the 7.0-7.5 % range for Rated A).  \n• Additional cardiovascular risk factors:  \n   – BMI 31.2 (BMI 30-32 band).  \n   – Blood pressure 142/92 mm Hg (controlled but elevated 140-145/90-95).  \n• No history of diabetes-related complications; non-smoker for 10 years.\n\nBecause he meets all criteria under UW-LI-5.3.27 for a Rated A profile—and does not trigger any elements that would elevate him to Rated B or Declined—Table 7.2 prescribes a +25 % premium adjustment.\n\nPlease relay this rating and reasoning to the applicant. If any new medical evidence emerges (e.g., improved HbA1c below 7.0 % over time), we can revisit the classification at policy anniversary.\n\nLet me know if you need further clarification.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\nSenior Life Underwriter",
