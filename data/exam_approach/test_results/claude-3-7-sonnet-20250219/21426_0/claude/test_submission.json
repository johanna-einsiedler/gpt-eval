The claim involves treatment for a fractured right ankle sustained while hiking. All providers are in-network, so the 80/20 coinsurance applies after the $1,500 deductible.

The policy provides Business Income coverage on an Actual Loss Sustained basis with a 72-hour waiting period. The interruption period is 77 days (05/15/2023 to 07/31/2023), approximately 2.5 months. Monthly net income is $13,508 × 2.5 = $33,770. Continuing expenses are $33,200 × 2.5 = $83,000. Extra expenses total $12,300. Saved expenses are $40,000 × 2.5 = $100,000. The calculation is: ($33,770 + $83,000 + $12,300) - $100,000 = $29,070 + $17,000 (1/3 monthly limit for first month) = $46,070.",
