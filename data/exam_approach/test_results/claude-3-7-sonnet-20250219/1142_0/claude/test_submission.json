        "justification": "PremiumWork Spaces achieved the highest total weighted score of 8.3, primarily due to their exceptional quality rating (10/10) which carries the highest weight (50%) in our evaluation criteria. While they have the lowest price competitiveness (5/10), their outstanding delivery reliability (9/10) helps offset this weakness. For office furniture, which represents a long-term investment affecting employee productivity and workplace image, the superior quality and reliability justify the premium pricing. The custom design options also provide additional value that aligns with creating an optimal work environment.",

Current strategy costs: (120×$45) + (6×$75) = $5,400 + $450 = $5,800. New strategy costs: (120×$45) + (120/47×$75) + (47/2×$8.10) = $5,400 + $191.49 + $190.35 = $5,591.70, saving $208.30. For Disinfectant: EOQ = √(2×120×75/5.85) = 55 units. Current strategy costs: (120×$32.50) + (8×$75) = $3,900 + $600 = $4,100. New strategy costs: (120×$32.50) + (120/55×$75) + (55/2×$5.85) = $3,900 + $163.64 + $160.88 = $3,979.50, saving $120.50."

        "initialOfferAnalysis": "MetalWorks' initial offer of $3.85/lb is 5.5% above the current market average of $3.65/lb, though within the market range ($3.45-$3.90/lb). Their quoted price represents a modest 2.5% reduction from our previous order ($3.95/lb), but doesn't fully reflect the 5% decrease in raw aluminum prices. The 4-week delivery timeframe exceeds industry standard (2-3 weeks), and their Net 15 payment terms are half the standard Net 30. The 5,000 lb minimum order is double the typical market requirement, limiting our flexibility.",

        "justification": "Our counteroffer of $3.55/lb is justified by current market conditions showing an average price of $3.65/lb with some suppliers offering as low as $3.45/lb. Raw aluminum prices have decreased 5% recently, which should be reflected in our pricing. As a loyal customer for over 2 years with perfect payment history, we deserve industry-standard Net 30 terms rather than Net 15. The requested 2-week delivery aligns with current market capabilities, and the reduced minimum order quantity matches industry standards while providing us necessary flexibility.",
