For the disinfectant: EOQ = sqrt((2 * 120 * 75) / (0.18 * 32.5)) = 25 units. The new strategy reduces ordering frequency and takes advantage of volume discounts, leading to cost savings."

        "initialOfferAnalysis": "The initial offer from MetalWorks Manufacturing is priced at $3.85 per lb, which is above the average market price of $3.65 per lb. The delivery timeframe of 4 weeks is longer than the typical 2-3 weeks, and the payment terms of Net 15 are less favorable than the standard Net 30. Given the recent decrease in raw aluminum prices and improved supply chain conditions, there is room to negotiate a better price and terms.",

        "justification": "The counteroffer of $3.60 per lb reflects the lower end of the current market price range and aligns with recent price decreases. Requesting Net 30 payment terms and a 3-week delivery timeframe brings the offer in line with industry standards, improving cash flow and project scheduling. These adjustments are reasonable given the improved market conditions and our long-standing relationship with the supplier.",
