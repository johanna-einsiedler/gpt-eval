Attorney involvement factor of 1.5x was applied per section 2.1. Property damage reserve includes repair costs ($8,750), rental expenses ($450), and a 10% contingency ($920) as required by section 2.2. Medical expense reserve covers current and anticipated treatment costs within policy limits per section 2.3.

The indemnity reserve was calculated using the compensation rate of $633.33 (2/3 of AWW) for an extended 12-week recovery period, plus a 7.5% PPD rating valued at $695.78 per point, with a 15% contingency per section 3.1. Medical reserves include $25,000 for surgery and $4,500 for post-surgical PT, with a 20% contingency for complications as required by section 3.2. Rehabilitation reserves of $9,000 were established based on potential vocational needs due to permanent restrictions, calculated at the standard rate of $4,500 per month for 2 months per section 3.3. This significant reserve increase of $38,641.10 is fully documented as required by section 5.3."

        "justification": "Following section 4.3, I identified multiple distinct exposures requiring separate reserves. For property damage to stores, I applied section 4.1 guidelines, calculating reserves based on documented repair costs and inventory damage with the required 15% contingency. Store 1 damage totals $46,920 and Store 2 damage totals $62,790, representing the highest exposure values. Business interruption reserves of $34,100 were calculated per section 4.2 using documented daily revenue losses for all three stores with a 10% contingency. These three exposures represent the most significant financial impacts. All calculations follow section 5.1 documentation requirements with detailed breakdowns of components and supporting evidence. The total reserve of $143,810 appropriately accounts for the claim's complexity while remaining within policy limits."
