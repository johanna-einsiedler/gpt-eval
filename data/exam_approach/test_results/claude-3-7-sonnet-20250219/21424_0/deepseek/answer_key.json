Adding lost wages of $3,200 and applying a pain and suffering multiplier of 3x medical expenses ($18,900) per section 2.1 for moderate injuries. Using a jurisdiction factor of 1.0 (average) and attorney factor of 1.5 (represented), the BI reserve calculates to $28,980. Property damage includes $8,750 repair plus $450 rental (10 days at $45) with 10% contingency per section 2.2, totaling $10,075. Medical expense reserve includes current and anticipated treatment costs of $5,800. All reserves comply with adequacy standards in section 1.2."

Indemnity reserve increased to $23,000 based on extended disability period (12 weeks at $633.33 = $7,600) plus potential PPD (7.5% rating at $695.78 per point = $5,218) with 15% contingency per section 3.1. Medical reserve increased to $45,600 to include surgery ($25,000), post-surgical PT (36 sessions at $125 = $4,500), and previous medical expenses ($8,000) with 20% contingency for complications per section 3.2. Added rehabilitation reserve of $9,000 for potential vocational services (2 months at $4,500) per section 3.3 due to possible inability to return to previous position. Total reserve increase of $57,100 is documented as required by section 5.3."

Property damage reserve of $142,300 includes inventory damage ($28,500 + $45,700 + $18,200 = $92,400), structural damage ($12,300 + $8,900 + $5,400 = $26,600), and common area damage ($12,000), with 15% contingency per section 4.1. Business interruption reserve of $34,100 covers revenue losses for all three stores ($9,500 + $15,000 + $6,500 = $31,000) with 10% contingency per section 4.2. Emergency response costs of $10,000 are set based on the shopping center's claim. Per section 4.4, I considered contractual obligations (indemnification clause) and potential subrogation from store owners' insurance. All exposures are documented separately with supporting evidence as required by section 5.1."
