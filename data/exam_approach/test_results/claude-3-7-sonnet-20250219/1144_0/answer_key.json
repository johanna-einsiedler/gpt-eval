        "supplier_B": "Supplier B excels in quality (0.7% rejection rate) and delivery reliability (97% on-time), with strong technical support (4-hour response time). Their price is slightly higher at $3.14, but compensated by excellent performance metrics and superior certifications.",
        "supplier_C": "Supplier C fails to meet both budget constraints ($3.25 > $3.20 maximum) and technical specifications (temperature range -30°C to +80°C below requirement). Their production capacity (45,000 units) is also below the minimum requirement of 50,000 units.",
        "supplier_D": "Supplier D offers the best overall value with the lowest total cost ($3.10) while maintaining excellent quality (1.1% rejection rate) and delivery performance (95% on-time). They have the highest production capacity (80,000 units) with quick ramp-up time and excellent financial stability (89/100).",
        "supplier_E": "Supplier E meets all specifications with acceptable performance metrics, but their pricing ($3.18) is on the higher end while offering no standout advantages. Their 30-day payment terms are also less favorable than other qualified suppliers.",
        "final_recommendation": "Supplier D is the top recommendation due to offering the lowest total cost ($3.10) while maintaining excellent quality, delivery reliability, and the highest production capacity (80,000 units) with quick 30-day ramp-up. Supplier B is the second choice, delivering exceptional quality (lowest rejection rate of 0.7%) and reliability (97% on-time delivery) with the best technical support, despite a slightly higher price point ($3.14)."
