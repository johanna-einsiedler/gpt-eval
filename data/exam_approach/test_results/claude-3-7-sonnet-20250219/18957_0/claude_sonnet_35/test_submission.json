        "response": "Dear Sarah Johnson,\n\nThank you for reaching out regarding your network infrastructure upgrade project. Based on your requirements, we've developed a comprehensive plan to address your needs:\n\n1. Scalability and Bandwidth:\nWe recommend upgrading to a 1 Gbps connection at each location, including the 15 new sites. This will provide ample bandwidth to support your growth and eliminate slowdowns during peak hours.\n\n2. Reliability and Business Continuity:\nWe'll implement a dual-carrier solution with automatic failover, ensuring 99.99% uptime and limiting downtime to under 15 minutes per incident. This addresses your critical need for continuous operations.\n\n3. Low Latency for Cloud Services:\nOur solution includes optimized routing and traffic prioritization to support your new cloud-based inventory management system, ensuring low latency for critical applications.\n\n4. Security and Compliance:\nWe'll implement a next-generation firewall solution and encrypt all data in transit, meeting PCI DSS requirements and addressing your board's security concerns. Regular security audits will be conducted to maintain compliance.\n\n5. Scalable Architecture:\nThe proposed solution is designed to easily accommodate your planned expansion and future growth beyond the initial 15 new locations.\n\n6. Implementation Timeline and Budget:\nWe can complete this project within your 4-month timeframe and $1.2 million budget. A detailed project plan will be provided upon approval.\n\nOur team is committed to delivering a robust, secure, and scalable network that meets your current needs and supports your future growth. We look forward to discussing this proposal in detail and addressing any questions you may have.\n\nBest regards,\nYour Network Architecture Team",
