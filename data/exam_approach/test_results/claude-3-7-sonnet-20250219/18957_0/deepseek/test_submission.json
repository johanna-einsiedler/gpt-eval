        "response": "Dear Sarah Johnson,\n\nThank you for reaching out regarding your network infrastructure upgrade needs. Based on your requirements, I recommend the following approach:\n\n1. Bandwidth Upgrade: We'll design a solution upgrading each location to 1 Gbps connections with QoS prioritization for critical systems during peak hours (2-5 PM).\n\n2. Reliability: We'll implement redundant connections with automatic failover to meet your 15-minute downtime requirement, using dual ISPs at each location.\n\n3. Security: The architecture will include PCI DSS-compliant segmentation for payment systems, next-gen firewalls, and encrypted connections for all sensitive data.\n\n4. Cloud Integration: For your inventory system, we'll ensure low-latency connections to the cloud provider with direct peering where possible.\n\n5. Expansion: The design will use a scalable hub-and-spoke model to easily incorporate new locations with consistent security policies.\n\n6. Budget & Timeline: Your budget and timeline are achievable with phased implementation starting with your highest-priority locations.\n\nNext steps would be to schedule a technical discovery session with your IT team to gather more detailed requirements. Please let me know a convenient time.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
