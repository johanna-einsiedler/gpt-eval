        "response": "Dear Sarah Johnson,\n\nThank you for reaching out to us regarding your network infrastructure upgrade. We understand the critical nature of your requirements and are committed to providing a solution that meets your needs.\n\n1. **Bandwidth and Connectivity**: We recommend upgrading your bandwidth to at least 500 Mbps, with the option to scale to 1 Gbps, to accommodate increased traffic and ensure seamless connectivity across all locations. This will help mitigate slowdowns during peak shopping hours.\n\n2. **Reliability and Continuity**: To address your concerns about outages, we propose implementing a robust backup solution with automatic failover capabilities, ensuring a maximum downtime of 15 minutes per incident.\n\n3. **Latency and Cloud Integration**: For your upcoming cloud-based inventory management system, we will ensure low latency connections to support real-time data processing and integration.\n\n4. **Security and Compliance**: We will implement advanced security protocols to protect customer payment information and ensure compliance with PCI DSS standards.\n\n5. **Scalability and Expansion**: Our solution will be designed to support your expansion to 15 new retail locations, ensuring scalability and future-proofing your network.\n\n6. **Budget and Timeline**: We are confident that we can deliver this project within your budget of $1.2 million and complete the implementation within the 4-month timeframe.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any further questions or require additional information. We look forward to working with you to enhance your network infrastructure.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\nNetwork Architecture Team",
