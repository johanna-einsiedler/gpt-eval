The discounts increase progressively to clear inventory by the September 15 deadline. Week 5 leverages the Labor Day weekend traffic surge with a compelling 60% markdown. The final week features the maximum 70% markdown to clear remaining inventory before the September 15 deadline. The schedule accounts for declining store traffic (5% weekly) while balancing revenue optimization and inventory clearance goals. Projected sales are calculated using the historical markdown performance data, adjusted for weekly traffic changes."
