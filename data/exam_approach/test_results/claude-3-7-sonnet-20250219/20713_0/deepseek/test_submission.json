Each week increases markdowns to maintain sales velocity, with steeper drops in weeks 3-4 when inventory is still substantial. The final weeks use aggressive markdowns to clear remaining stock before new season arrives. Labor Day weekend (week 6) benefits from maximum markdown to capitalize on increased traffic. Projections account for 5% weekly traffic decline and historical markdown performance."
