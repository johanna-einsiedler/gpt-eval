The markdowns increase progressively each week to accelerate sales velocity as we approach the clearance deadline. The strategy capitalizes on Labor Day weekend traffic in week 5 with a significant 60% markdown to drive volume. The final week features the maximum 70% markdown to ensure all inventory is cleared before the September 15 deadline. This approach balances revenue optimization with inventory clearance goals, with projected total revenue of $30,908 across all weeks."
