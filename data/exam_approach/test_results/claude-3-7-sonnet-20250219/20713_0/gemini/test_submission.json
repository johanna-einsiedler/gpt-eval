Markdown percentages are increased weekly to accelerate sales velocity, leveraging historical data showing higher markdown percentages drive significant sales increases. We anticipate a decrease in base sales each week by 5% due to declining traffic, but the markdown percentages are designed to more than offset this decrease and clear inventory. Labor Day weekend in week 5 is considered to provide a sales boost even with a higher markdown percentage already in place. The goal is to maximize revenue while fully clearing inventory before new season arrival."
