    "strategy_explanation": "The Debt Avalanche method was chosen, prioritizing debts from highest interest rate (CC1 @ 22.99%) to lowest (SL1 @ 5.5%). This strategy minimizes total interest paid, aligning with the client's goal of eliminating high-interest debt efficiently. All available disposable income ($1500/month) is allocated, paying minimums on lower-interest debts while aggressively paying down the highest-interest debt first, then snowballing payments to the next highest."
