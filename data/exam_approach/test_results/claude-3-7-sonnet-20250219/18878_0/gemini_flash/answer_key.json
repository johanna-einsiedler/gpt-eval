According to our records, the Department Manager met with you on [date] and provided a written response on [date]. If you believe proper procedure wasn't followed, I'd like to understand the specific issue. Could you clarify which aspect of Article 7.3 you believe was violated? This will help us address your concern accurately and determine appropriate next steps in the grievance process.",

Let's take a brief pause to ensure we're addressing your concerns effectively. Everyone's perspective is valuable here.

Would it help if we documented your specific concerns before moving forward?",
