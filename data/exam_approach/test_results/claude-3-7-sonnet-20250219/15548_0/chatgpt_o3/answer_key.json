There's a clear correlation between attendance frequency and satisfaction—weekly attendees report higher satisfaction (4.2/5.0 average) than those who rarely attend (2.7/5.0 average). Major barriers to participation include scheduling conflicts (particularly for yoga classes) and skill level concerns (yoga classes being too advanced for beginners, especially noted by IT department). Program-specific feedback indicates walking groups need more varied routes (Marketing), nutrition workshops are valued for practical information (Finance), stress management sessions are particularly beneficial (IT), and fitness challenges are appreciated for motivation (Marketing and Operations). Overall, the data suggests that tailoring programs to departmental preferences, offering beginner-friendly options, and addressing scheduling conflicts could significantly improve participation and satisfaction.",
