A histogram reveals a long tail extending towards higher values. This skewness is further confirmed by calculating the skewness coefficient, which is significantly greater than zero. The data also exhibits potential multimodality, possibly due to different spending patterns across transaction categories. A log transformation might help normalize the data, but the inherent skewness suggests that simple random sampling may not be the most efficient approach for auditing.",

This approach ensures representation of all transaction sizes and focuses on high-value transactions.",

The data exhibits clusters that are not only spatially separated but also have different densities and shapes. K-means, for instance, minimizes the within-cluster sum of squares, which is sensitive to outliers and assumes clusters are convex. Hierarchical clustering, while more flexible, still relies on distance metrics that may not accurately capture the relationships between points in different clusters, especially when clusters are elongated or non-convex. The presence of varying densities and non-spherical shapes violates the assumptions underlying these methods, leading to suboptimal clustering results.",

DBSCAN identifies clusters based on density connectivity, which is more robust to non-spherical clusters and varying densities. However, standard Euclidean distance may not be optimal.

This allows DBSCAN to adapt to the shape and orientation of the clusters, improving its performance.",

The Mahalanobis distance is defined as d(x, y) = sqrt((x - y)^T * S^-1 * (x - y)), where x and y are data points and S is the covariance matrix of the data. Using the Mahalanobis distance allows DBSCAN to account for the correlation between features within each cluster, effectively normalizing the data and improving cluster separation.",
