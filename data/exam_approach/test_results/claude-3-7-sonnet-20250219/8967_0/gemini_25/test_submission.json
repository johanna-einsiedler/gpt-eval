Visual inspection (e.g., histogram) would show a concentration of data points at the lower end of the amount scale and a long tail extending towards higher values. Statistical measures would confirm this: a positive skewness coefficient (e.g., > 1, based on typical transaction data like the dummy data generated: skewness around 3-5) and high kurtosis (leptokurtic, e.g., > 3, dummy data kurtosis around 15-30), indicating heavier tails than a normal distribution. The mean transaction amount is expected to be significantly larger than the median due to the influence of these large transactions. This skewness and high variance imply that simple random sampling might not efficiently capture the population characteristics, especially concerning total value or average value of high-amount transactions, which are often critical for auditing.",

The allocation of sample sizes to strata can be proportional to the stratum's size (N_h/N), or optimized using Neyman allocation if stratum variances are known or can be estimated (allocating more samples to larger, more variable strata).

By creating strata that are internally homogeneous (low S_h^2) and externally heterogeneous, the overall Var(ȳ_st) can be made smaller than Var(ȳ_srs) = (S^2/n) * (1 - n/N).

It begins by generating B bootstrap samples and calculating the statistic of interest for each. The core idea is to adjust the standard α/2 and 1-α/2 percentiles of the bootstrap distribution using a correction factor. This factor depends on the skewness coefficient (γ) of the bootstrap distribution of the statistic and an empirically derived adjustment function, f(α) = 0.1α. Specifically, the lower percentile becomes α/2 - γ·f(α) and the upper becomes 1-α/2 + γ·f(α). This shifts the interval to counteract the skewness, aiming for better coverage probabilities than traditional methods. For symmetric distributions (γ=0), APB reduces to the standard percentile bootstrap.",

K-Means, for instance, uses Euclidean distance and aims to minimize within-cluster sum of squares. This implicitly assumes that clusters are spherical (isotropic), of similar sizes, and roughly equal density. The provided data's 'known_group' structure (A: x1 low, x2 high, x3 low-mid; B: x1 high, x2 low, x3 high; etc.) suggests clusters might be defined by specific dimensional characteristics, potentially leading to non-spherical (e.g., ellipsoidal or hyper-rectangular) shapes or varying orientations in the feature space. If features have different scales or variances contributing to cluster definition, K-Means can be dominated by dimensions with larger variances. While scaling can help, K-Means cannot inherently model clusters with different covariance structures (e.g., one cluster elongated along x1-axis, another along x2-axis). Density-based methods like DBSCAN might also struggle if clusters have significantly varying densities or are only separated by small gaps in a high-dimensional space.",

GMM assumes that the data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions, where each Gaussian component corresponds to a cluster.

This is achieved by estimating a mean vector and a full covariance matrix for each component (cluster). The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate these parameters. The number of components is set to 4, corresponding to the known number of groups. Data will be standardized before applying GMM to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating.",

N(x | μ_k, Σ_k) is the multivariate Gaussian probability density function. The parameters Θ = {π_k, μ_k, Σ_k}_{k=1}^K are estimated using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which iteratively computes posterior probabilities of component membership (E-step) and updates parameters to maximize the expected log-likelihood (M-step).

However, the magnitude of this effect is considerably smaller than what a naive analysis would suggest, implying that the original claim might have overestimated the effect size by not controlling for confounders. While the adjusted analysis provides a more robust estimate, its causal interpretation still relies on the assumption of 'no unobserved confounders' and correct model specification.
