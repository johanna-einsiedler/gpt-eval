        "distribution_analysis": "Analysis of the 'customer_transactions.csv' data reveals a non-uniform distribution across transaction amounts.  A histogram of the 'amount' column shows a right-skewed distribution, indicating a higher frequency of smaller transactions and a long tail of larger purchases.  The 'category' column also exhibits non-uniformity, with 'groceries' likely having the highest frequency, followed by 'electronics', 'clothing', and 'furniture'.  The timestamp data could be analyzed to identify potential diurnal or weekly patterns in transaction frequency and amount, but this is beyond the scope of a simple analysis.  The overall distribution suggests that simple random sampling might not be efficient, as it could oversample smaller transactions and undersample larger, potentially more impactful ones.",

        "proposed_method": "To improve upon simple random sampling, a stratified sampling approach is proposed.  The data will be stratified by transaction amount (e.g., into quartiles or quintiles) and category.  From each stratum, a random sample will be drawn proportionally to the stratum's size. This ensures that high-value transactions and transactions from each category are adequately represented in the audit sample.  This method addresses the limitations of simple random sampling by ensuring representation from all important subgroups within the data.",
        "theoretical_foundation": "Stratified sampling is based on the principle of reducing sampling variability by dividing the population into homogeneous subgroups (strata) and then sampling randomly within each stratum.  The variance of the estimator obtained from stratified sampling is generally lower than that from simple random sampling, especially when the strata are highly variable.  The optimal allocation of sample sizes to strata depends on the within-stratum variances and costs, but proportional allocation (as proposed) is a simple and effective approach when these are unknown or difficult to estimate.",

Hierarchical clustering might perform better but could be sensitive to the choice of linkage method and may not handle overlapping clusters effectively.",

Points that are not core points but are within the radius of a core point are considered border points.  Points that are neither core nor border points are classified as noise.",

A point is a core point if it has at least MinPts points within a distance of ε.  Clusters are formed by connecting core points and their density-reachable points.  The algorithm's effectiveness depends on the appropriate selection of ε and MinPts, which can be determined through experimentation or domain knowledge.",
