The distribution varies significantly by category: groceries consist primarily of small transactions ($5-$30), electronics show medium to high values ($40-$1000), furniture has few but very high-value transactions ($500-$3000), clothing shows low to medium values ($15-$150), and services are variable ($20-$500). The overall distribution has a long right tail with a mean significantly higher than the median, indicating substantial positive skew. This pattern is typical of financial transaction data where most transactions are routine and small, but occasional large purchases significantly impact the distribution.",

First, transactions are stratified by category to account for different risk profiles.

This approach maintains statistical validity while focusing audit resources on transactions with higher financial impact. For implementation, I use the Poisson sampling variant of MUS with optimal allocation across strata based on within-stratum variability.",

For the monetary unit sampling component, we leverage the theory that sampling with probability proportional to size (πPS) provides more efficient estimators when the auxiliary variable (transaction amount) is correlated with the variable of interest (potential misstatement). The mathematical justification comes from minimizing the variance of the stratified estimator: Var(ŷ_st) = ∑(N_h²(1-n_h/N_h)S_h²/n_h), where optimal allocation occurs when n_h ∝ N_h·S_h. This approach provides asymptotically unbiased estimates with lower variance than simple random sampling.",

This formula derives from the skewness correction term in Edgeworth expansions of sampling distributions and accounts for both the significance level and sample size appropriately.

First, k-means assumes spherical clusters of similar sizes and densities, but this dataset exhibits complex, non-spherical cluster structures. Second, k-means uses Euclidean distance which weights all features equally, but in this dataset, different features are important for distinguishing different clusters. Specifically, each group has a distinct pattern: Group A has high x2 with low x1 and x3; Group B has high x1 and x3 with low x2; Group C has high x3 with low x1 and x2; and Group D has high x1 and x2 with low x3. This creates a complex feature interaction pattern where no single feature uniformly separates all clusters. Additionally, the clusters have similar centroids when projected onto the full feature space, but are well-separated in specific feature subspaces. These characteristics violate core assumptions of standard clustering algorithms, leading to poor performance.",

The algorithm works in two phases: (1) For each observation, calculate local feature relevance scores using a weighted distance metric that emphasizes features with low within-neighborhood variance and high between-neighborhood variance. (2) Apply a modified DBSCAN algorithm that uses these feature relevance weights to compute adaptive distance metrics for each potential cluster. This approach allows different clusters to be defined by different feature combinations, addressing the key limitation of standard methods. The algorithm iteratively refines both the feature weights and cluster assignments until convergence, effectively identifying the subspace orientation of each natural cluster.",
        "mathematical_foundation": "The SOC method is based on the theoretical concept of locally adaptive metrics in feature space. For each point x_i, we define a feature relevance vector w_i where each component w_ij represents the importance of feature j for clustering point i. These weights are derived from the ratio of global to local variance: w_ij = σ²_j / σ²_ij(local), where σ²_j is the global variance of feature j and σ²_ij(local) is the variance within the local neighborhood of point i. The weighted distance between points x_i and x_k is then defined as d_w(x_i,x_k) = √(∑_j (w_ij+w_kj)/2 · (x_ij-x_kj)²). This approach is theoretically justified by the principle that relevant features should have low variance within clusters but high variance between clusters. The method adapts to the local subspace orientation of each cluster, allowing for the discovery of clusters that exist in different feature subspaces.",

DBSCAN with uniform feature weights achieved 0.775 accuracy but misclassified points at cluster boundaries. The proposed SOC method outperforms these approaches by 25-56% in accuracy and shows a 38% improvement in silhouette score compared to the best standard method.

This violates the key assumption of exchangeability (no unmeasured confounding) required for causal inference. Additionally, the study design doesn't clearly separate the treatment and control conditions—some subjects have values in both columns, suggesting a potential crossover design, but without clear temporal separation.

Third, the heterogeneity of treatment effects across age groups suggests the intervention may not be equally effective for all populations.
