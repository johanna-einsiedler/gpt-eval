Transaction amounts follow a heavy-tailed distribution with most transactions being small to medium-sized (under $100), but with significant outliers exceeding $1000. The category distribution is unbalanced, with 'groceries' representing approximately 40% of transactions, 'electronics' 25%, 'clothing' 15%, 'furniture' 10%, and other categories making up the remainder. Temporally, transactions show daily cyclical patterns with higher volumes during midday hours. This combination of skewed monetary values and categorical imbalance makes simple random sampling inefficient for audit purposes, as it would likely miss important high-value transactions that represent significant financial risk.",

This approach first stratifies transactions by category to ensure representation across business segments.

Additionally, the method incorporates temporal stratification to ensure coverage across different time periods, addressing potential seasonal or daily patterns in transaction behavior.",

The inclusion probability for transaction i is defined as π_i = n × (x_i / ∑x_i) within each stratum, where x_i is the transaction amount and n is the desired sample size. This creates a self-weighting sample where each dollar has an equal probability of selection. The Horvitz-Thompson estimator can then be used for unbiased estimation of population parameters. The theoretical variance of this estimator is minimized when the correlation between the sampling measure (transaction amount) and the audit interest variable (error risk) is high.",

First, these methods typically rely on distance metrics that treat all dimensions equally, but the data exhibits a structure where different clusters are defined by different feature subspaces. For example, group A is primarily distinguished by high values in x2, while group B shows high values in x1 and x3. This subspace clustering phenomenon violates the implicit assumption in standard methods that clusters exist in the full feature space. Second, traditional methods assume isotropic cluster shapes (especially k-means), but these clusters have complex orientations in the feature space. Third, the data exhibits a form of feature relevance that varies by cluster - each group is characterized by a unique pattern of feature importance that global distance metrics cannot capture. Finally, there's likely feature correlation within clusters that standard Euclidean distance fails to account for, as it assumes feature independence.",

The algorithm operates in two phases: First, it performs dimension-wise density estimation to identify potentially relevant subspaces for each cluster. Second, it employs an iterative process that alternates between (a) assigning points to clusters based on their distance in the cluster-specific relevant subspace and (b) updating the subspace orientation and feature weights for each cluster. The distance metric is customized for each cluster k as d_k(x,y) = √(∑(w_ki(x_i-y_i)²)), where w_ki is the weight of feature i for cluster k, determined by the feature's discriminative power for that specific cluster.",

For each cluster k, we define a weight vector w_k that determines the relevance of each dimension. These weights are optimized to minimize the within-cluster dispersion in the weighted feature space while maximizing between-cluster separation. Mathematically, we maximize the objective function J(C,W) = ∑_k ∑_{i∈C_k} w_k^T(x_i-μ_k)²/∑_k |C_k|, subject to constraints ∑_j w_kj = 1 and w_kj ≥ 0 for all k,j. This formulation relates to the theoretical framework of locally adaptive distance metrics and can be shown to converge to a local optimum under certain conditions.
