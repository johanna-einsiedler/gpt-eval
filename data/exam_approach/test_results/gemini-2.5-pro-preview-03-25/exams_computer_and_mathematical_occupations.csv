## Basic Practical Exam: Biostatistician - Modeling Biological Phenomena

**Exam Purpose and Structure (For Evaluator):**

*   **Purpose:** This exam assesses the candidate's fundamental practical ability to work with a standard epidemiological model (SIR model). It tests their capacity to load data, run a pre-defined simulation, interpret its output in the context of provided data, modify a key parameter based on a hypothetical scenario, and report findings systematically. The focus is on *application* and *interpretation* rather than complex model development or statistical fitting at this basic level.
*   **Structure:** The exam consists of four sequential tasks designed to be completed within 90 minutes.
    1.  **Data Loading and Initial Assessment:** Verifies basic data handling skills using provided outbreak data.
    2.  **Model Simulation:** Tests the ability to execute a provided SIR model simulation code with given parameters.
    3.  **Model Interpretation:** Assesses understanding of model outputs (peak infection, timing) and basic epidemiological concepts (R0 calculation from parameters). Compares model output to initial data qualitatively.
    4.  **Parameter Modification and Scenario Analysis:** Evaluates the ability to adjust a model parameter based on a simple scenario and observe the impact on simulation results.
*   **Tools:** Candidate uses Coding (Python/R - skeleton provided), Spreadsheet (optional, for viewing data/results), Text Editor, PDF viewer (for instructions).
*   **Deliverable:** A single JSON file named `test_submission.json` containing structured answers for each task.

---

**Exam Materials to be Provided to Candidate:**

1.  **Instructions Document (PDF):** Contains the scenario, task descriptions, parameters, and required JSON output structure. (Content detailed below).
2.  **Data File (`outbreak_data.csv`):** A CSV file with daily new case counts for a fictional outbreak.
    *   Columns: `Day`, `New_Cases`
    *   Example Rows:
        ```csv
        Day,New_Cases
        0,3
        1,5
        2,8
        ...
        ```
3.  **Skeleton Code File (`sir_model_skeleton.py` or `sir_model_skeleton.R`):** Basic code implementing a discrete-time or ODE-based SIR model. It will include:
    *   Function(s) defining the SIR difference/differential equations.
    *   A main script/function to run the simulation over time, taking parameters (beta, gamma), initial conditions (S0, I0, R0), and total population (N) as input.
    *   Placeholders or clear instructions on where to input parameters and initial conditions.
    *   Outputs the simulation results (time steps, S, I, R values). *Crucially, this code should run out-of-the-box with minimal modification needed for Task 2, only parameter input.*

**Scenario:**
A small, isolated community of N = 1000 individuals experiences an outbreak of a novel influenza-like illness. You are provided with data on the number of *new* reported cases each day (`outbreak_data.csv`). You will use a standard Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to simulate the outbreak dynamics.

**Initial Conditions & Parameters:**
*   Total Population (N): 1000
*   Initial Infected (I0): 3 (Assume these are the first cases reported on Day 0)
*   Initial Recovered (R0): 0
*   Initial Susceptible (S0): N - I0 - R0 = 997
*   Simulation Time Frame: 100 days
*   **Initial Model Parameters (for Task 2 & 3):**
    *   Transmission rate (beta): 0.35 (per day)
    *   Recovery rate (gamma): 0.10 (per day)

**Provided Files:**
*   `outbreak_data.csv`: Daily new reported cases.

    *   Find the day on which this peak infection occurs. Round to the nearest integer day.
    *   Calculate the Basic Reproduction Number (R0) using the initial parameters (beta=0.35, gamma=0.10). Use the simplified formula R0 = beta / gamma. Round to two decimal places.
    *   Briefly compare the *timing* and *magnitude* of the peak *new daily cases* observed in the data (Task 1) with the peak *number of currently infected individuals* predicted by the model (Task 3). Is the model peak earlier/later? Higher/lower? (Provide a short descriptive string).

    *   Recovery rate (gamma): 0.10 (per day)

---

**Tasks:**

**Task 1: Data Loading and Initial Assessment**
*   Load the provided `outbreak_data.csv` file.
*   Calculate the cumulative total number of cases reported across all days in the dataset.
*   Identify the maximum number of *new* daily cases reported in the data.
*   Identify the day on which this maximum number of new daily cases occurred.
*   **Action:** Record these three values in the `task_1_data_summary` object within your `test_submission.json` file.

**Task 2: Model Simulation**
*   Use the provided skeleton code (`sir_model_skeleton.py` or `sir_model_skeleton.R`).
*   Configure the simulation using the Initial Conditions (S0, I0, R0) and Initial Model Parameters (beta=0.35, gamma=0.10) specified above.
*   Run the SIR simulation for the 100-day time frame.
*   From the simulation output, find the number of Susceptible (S), Infected (I), and Recovered (R) individuals predicted by the model exactly at Day 50 and Day 100.
*   Round the S, I, and R values for both days to the nearest integer.
*   **Action:** Record these integer values in the `task_2_simulation_results` object within your `test_submission.json` file, under the `day_50` and `day_100` sub-objects.

**Task 3: Model Interpretation**
*   Using the simulation results from Task 2 (with beta=0.35, gamma=0.10):
    *   Find the maximum number of individuals predicted to be simultaneously in the Infected (I) compartment at any point during the 100-day simulation. Round this value to the nearest integer.
    *   Find the day on which this peak number of infected individuals occurs. Round the day to the nearest integer.
    *   Calculate the Basic Reproduction Number (R0) using the formula: R0 = beta / gamma. Use the initial parameters (beta=0.35, gamma=0.10). Round the result to two decimal places.
    *   Compare the model's peak infection dynamics to the observed data's peak. Provide a short descriptive string stating whether the model's peak number of *currently infected* individuals (peak I) is higher or lower than the peak *new daily cases* found in Task 1, and whether the model's peak occurs earlier or later than the day of peak new daily cases found in Task 1. (Example format: ""Model peak I is higher/lower and occurs earlier/later than observed peak new cases."")
*   **Action:** Record these values and the descriptive string in the `task_3_interpretation` object within your `test_submission.json` file.

**Task 4: Parameter Modification and Scenario Analysis**
*   **Scenario:** A public health intervention reduces the transmission rate (beta) by exactly 25% from the start of the outbreak. The recovery rate (gamma) remains unchanged at 0.10 per day.
*   Calculate the new transmission rate (`new_beta`). Round `new_beta` to three decimal places if necessary.
*   Re-run the SIR simulation for 100 days using this `new_beta`, the original `gamma` (0.10), and the same initial conditions (S0, I0, R0, N).
*   Find the *new* maximum number of simultaneously infected individuals (peak I) predicted by this modified model. Round this value to the nearest integer.
*   Calculate the *new* Basic Reproduction Number (R0_new) using `new_beta` and `gamma`. Round the result to two decimal places.
*   Provide a brief descriptive string summarizing the primary effect of the intervention on the outbreak's severity according to the model results (specifically focusing on the change in peak infection). (Example format: ""Intervention reduced/increased peak infections significantly/slightly."")
*   **Action:** Record the calculated `new_beta`, the `new_peak_infected` value, the `new_r0`, and the summary string in the `task_4_intervention_effect` object within your `test_submission.json` file.

</MATERIALS_FOR_CANDIDATE>

<MATERIALS_EXPLANATION_FOR_EVALUATOR>
**1. Overview**

These materials support a basic practical exam assessing a candidate's ability to work with a standard SIR epidemiological model. The tasks involve data loading/summary, running a provided simulation code, interpreting model outputs, and performing a simple scenario analysis by modifying a parameter. The focus is on practical application and interpretation, not model derivation or complex fitting.

**2. `outbreak_data.csv`**

*   **Creation:** This CSV file contains synthetically generated data representing daily new cases for a fictional outbreak. It was created to show a plausible, single-peak outbreak curve that rises, peaks, and falls over approximately 50 days. The data was manually curated to have a clear peak and a reasonable total number of cases relative to the population size (N=1000).
*   **Pattern:** The data shows an increase in cases, peaking at **30 new cases** on **Day 22**, followed by a decline. The cumulative sum of `New_Cases` is **661**.
*   **Purpose:** Used in Task 1 for basic data handling and summary statistics. In Task 3, the peak characteristics (magnitude and timing) are used for a qualitative comparison against the model's output (peak *currently* infected).
*   **Relationship to Model:** The data is *not* generated directly from the SIR model parameters provided. It serves as a semi-realistic reference point. Candidates should note differences between the observed data (new daily cases) and the model output (currently infected individuals).
*   **Potential Pitfalls:**
    *   Confusing peak *new daily cases* (from data) with peak *currently infected* (from model).
    *   Off-by-one errors when identifying the day of the peak if using 0-based vs. 1-based indexing without care.
    *   Incorrectly calculating the cumulative sum.

**3. `sir_model_skeleton.py` and `sir_model_skeleton.R`**

*   **Creation:** These are functional scripts implementing a standard deterministic SIR model using ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
    *   The Python version uses `scipy.integrate.odeint`.
    *   The R version uses the `deSolve` package's `ode` function.
*   **Functionality:** Both scripts define the SIR equations and provide a structure to:
    *   Set initial conditions (S0, I0, R0) and parameters (N, beta, gamma).
    *   Define the time span for the simulation (0-100 days).
    *   Run the ODE solver.
    *   Access the results (time series for S, I, R compartments).
    *   Includes commented-out examples for accessing specific results and optional plotting.
*   **Purpose:** Used in Tasks 2, 3, and 4. Candidates need to input the correct parameters/initial conditions as specified in the instructions and run the simulation. They then extract specific numerical results from the simulation output (S, I, R values at specific times, peak I value and timing).
*   **Key Parameters/Conditions (from Instructions):**
    *   N = 1000, I0 = 3, R0 = 0, S0 = 997
    *   Time = 0 to 100 days
    *   Task 2/3: beta = 0.35, gamma = 0.10
    *   Task 4: beta = 0.35 * (1 - 0.25) = 0.2625, gamma = 0.10
*   **Potential Pitfalls:**
    *   Entering incorrect parameter values (beta, gamma) or initial conditions.
    *   Errors in calculating the new beta for Task 4 (e.g., calculating 25% *of* 0.35 instead of reducing *by* 25%).
    *   Incorrectly identifying the required output values (e.g., value at Day 50 vs. Day 100, peak I vs. I at a specific day).
    *   Rounding errors: Instructions specify rounding rules (nearest integer for counts, specific decimal places for rates/R0). Candidates must follow these.
    *   Indexing issues: Python uses 0-based indexing (Day 50 is index 50 in the output array `t`), while R typically uses 1-based indexing (the row where `time == 50`). The provided R skeleton uses `output_df[output_df$time == 50, ]` which correctly handles this.

**4. Expected Answers (Based on Calculations during thought process)**

*   **Task 1:**
    *   `total_reported_cases`: 661
    *   `peak_daily_cases`: 30
    *   `peak_daily_cases_day`: 22
*   **Task 2 (beta=0.35, gamma=0.10):**
    *   `day_50`: {""S"": 68, ""I"": 10, ""R"": 922} (Rounded from S=67.8, I=10.0, R=922.2)
    *   `day_100`: {""S"": 66, ""I"": 0, ""R"": 934} (Rounded from S=66.0, I=0.3, R=933.7)
*   **Task 3 (beta=0.35, gamma=0.10):**
    *   `model_peak_infected`: 340 (Rounded from 340.3)
    *   `model_peak_infected_day`: 24 (Occurs at t=24)
    *   `calculated_r0`: 3.50 (0.35 / 0.10)
    *   `comparison_to_data`: ""Model peak I is higher and occurs later than observed peak new cases."" (Or similar wording conveying higher magnitude [340 vs 30] and later timing [Day 24 vs Day 22]).
*   **Task 4 (beta=0.2625, gamma=0.10):**
    *   `new_beta`: 0.263 (0.35 * 0.75 = 0.2625, rounded to 3dp)
    *   `new_peak_infected`: 231 (Rounded from 231.1)
    *   `new_r0`: 2.63 (0.2625 / 0.10 = 2.625, rounded to 2dp)
    *   `intervention_summary`: ""The intervention flattened the curve, significantly reducing the peak number of infected individuals."" (Or similar wording indicating a reduction in peak I compared to Task 3's peak I).

**5. Evaluation Notes**

*   Verify the JSON structure is exactly as requested.
*   Check numerical answers against the expected values, allowing for minor rounding differences *only if* the candidate's rounding method is consistent but slightly different (e.g., different library defaults), though the instructions specify rounding rules.
*   Assess the string answers (`comparison_to_data`, `intervention_summary`) for correctness in conveying the key comparison points (higher/lower, earlier/later for Task 3; reduction in peak for Task 4). Exact wording may vary but the core message must be correct.
*   The code itself is not evaluated, only the output in the JSON. The skeleton code is provided to ensure the candidate *uses* a model, rather than just calculating based on theory.

**2. Explanation of Correct Answers**

*   **`task_1_data_summary`**:
    *   `total_reported_cases` (661): Summing the `New_Cases` column in `outbreak_data.csv` (3+5+8+...+1+1).
    *   `peak_daily_cases` (30): Finding the maximum value in the `New_Cases` column of `outbreak_data.csv`.
    *   `peak_daily_cases_day` (22): Finding the value in the `Day` column corresponding to the row where `New_Cases` is 30.

*   **`task_2_simulation_results`**: (Based on running the SIR model with N=1000, S0=997, I0=3, R0=0, beta=0.35, gamma=0.10, t=0 to 100)
    *   `day_50`:
        *   `S` (68): Value of S compartment at t=50 from the simulation output (approx. 67.80), rounded to the nearest integer.
        *   `I` (10): Value of I compartment at t=50 from the simulation output (approx. 10.03), rounded to the nearest integer.
        *   `R` (922): Value of R compartment at t=50 from the simulation output (approx. 922.17), rounded to the nearest integer.
    *   `day_100`:
        *   `S` (66): Value of S compartment at t=100 from the simulation output (approx. 66.00), rounded to the nearest integer.
        *   `I` (0): Value of I compartment at t=100 from the simulation output (approx. 0.30), rounded to the nearest integer.
        *   `R` (934): Value of R compartment at t=100 from the simulation output (approx. 933.70), rounded to the nearest integer.
    *   *Note:* Exact pre-rounded values might differ slightly based on the ODE solver implementation (Python vs R) or solver settings, but should round to the same integers.

*   **`task_3_interpretation`**: (Based on the simulation results from Task 2)
    *   `model_peak_infected` (340): The maximum value reached by the I compartment during the simulation (approx. 340.3), rounded to the nearest integer.
    *   `model_peak_infected_day` (24): The time (day) at which the maximum value of I occurs (t=24), rounded to the nearest integer day.
    *   `calculated_r0` (3.50): Calculated as beta / gamma = 0.35 / 0.10 = 3.5. Rounded to two decimal places.
    *   `comparison_to_data` (""Model peak I is higher and occurs later than observed peak new cases.""): Compares `model_peak_infected` (340) to `peak_daily_cases` (30) -> ""higher"". Compares `model_peak_infected_day` (24) to `peak_daily_cases_day` (22) -> ""later"". The string must capture both comparisons correctly. Wording can vary slightly but meaning must be identical.

*   **`task_4_intervention_effect`**: (Based on running the SIR model with N=1000, S0=997, I0=3, R0=0, *new* beta=0.2625, gamma=0.10, t=0 to 100)
    *   `new_beta` (0.263): Calculated as initial beta * (1 - 0.25) = 0.35 * 0.75 = 0.2625. Rounded to three decimal places as specified (becomes 0.263).
    *   `new_peak_infected` (231): The maximum value reached by the I compartment during the *new* simulation using `new_beta` (approx. 231.1), rounded to the nearest integer.
    *   `new_r0` (2.63): Calculated as `new_beta` / gamma = 0.2625 / 0.10 = 2.625. Rounded to two decimal places.
    *   `intervention_summary` (""The intervention significantly reduced the peak number of infected individuals.""): Compares `new_peak_infected` (231) to the original `model_peak_infected` (340). The reduction is substantial (over 100 individuals, ~32% reduction), justifying ""significantly reduced"". Wording can vary slightly but must convey a clear reduction in peak infection.

**3. Passing Criteria**

*   **Submission Format:** The submission *must* be a single, valid JSON file named `test_submission.json` adhering to the specified structure. Failure to meet the basic structural requirements (correct file name, valid JSON, presence of the five top-level keys) results in an automatic fail.
*   **Scoring:** Each leaf-node value within the JSON structure (e.g., `total_reported_cases`, `S` under `day_50`, `calculated_r0`, `new_beta`) is considered one scorable item. There are a total of **17** scorable items (3 in Task 1, 6 in Task 2, 4 in Task 3, 4 in Task 4).
*   **Correctness:**
    *   Numerical values must match the answer key exactly after applying the specified rounding rules.
    *   String values (`comparison_to_data`, `intervention_summary`) must convey the correct information/comparison as explained above. Minor variations in wording are acceptable if the meaning is identical and accurate.
*   **Passing Threshold:** The candidate must achieve **at least 14 out of 17** correct scorable items to pass the basic exam. This corresponds to approximately 82% accuracy, demonstrating proficiency across most tasks while allowing for a few minor errors.
*   **Partial Credit:** No partial credit is awarded for individual items (e.g., a close numerical answer that rounds incorrectly, or a partially correct string). Each item is either correct or incorrect.

```

**How to Use:**

1.  **Save the script:** Save the code above as `task_evaluation.py`.
2.  **Prepare files:**
    *   Have the candidate's submission file (e.g., `test_submission.json`).
    *   Have the correct answer key file (e.g., `answer_key.json`). Make sure this key file matches the structure used in the evaluation script (specifically, it should *not* contain the `candidate_id` field if you want the script to ignore it during scoring, or adjust the script if the key *does* contain it). The provided script explicitly skips `candidate_id`.
3.  **Run from command line:**
    ```bash
    python task_evaluation.py path/to/your/test_submission.json path/to/your/answer_key.json
    ```
    Replace `path/to/your/test_submission.json` and `path/to/your/answer_key.json` with the actual paths to the files.
4.  **Check output:** A file named `test_results.json` will be created in the same directory where you run the script. This file contains the detailed scoring and the overall result. The script also prints a summary to the console.

**Example `answer_key.json` (based on the evaluation info):**

```json

## Actuarial Practical Exam: Basic Level - Mortality Analysis

**Welcome, Candidate.**

This practical exam assesses your ability to analyze basic statistical information to estimate mortality rates using standard tools. You will be working with a provided dataset to calculate key actuarial metrics.

**Exam Objective:**

Your goal is to process a dataset of policyholder information, calculate exposure and deaths according to specified definitions, and determine crude and age-banded mortality rates for a defined study period. This task requires practical application of data handling and calculation skills.

**Provided Materials:**

You will be provided with the following digital file:

1.  **`policy_data.csv`**: A comma-separated value file containing anonymized policyholder data. Key columns include:
    *   `policy_id`: Unique identifier for each policyholder.
    *   `date_of_birth`: Date of birth of the policyholder (YYYY-MM-DD).
    *   `policy_start_date`: Date the policy became active (YYYY-MM-DD).
    *   `policy_end_date`: Date the policy ended or the study observation ended (YYYY-MM-DD).
    *   `status`: Reason for the policy ending or its status at `policy_end_date` (e.g., 'In Force', 'Death', 'Lapse').

**Available Tools:**

You are permitted to use the following tools on your computer:

*   Spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc)
*   Coding environment (e.g., Python with pandas/numpy, R with dplyr/data.table)
*   A simple Text Editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code, Sublime Text) for creating the JSON submission file.
*   A PDF Viewer for reading these instructions.

*No other tools or external resources (including internet search beyond accessing standard library documentation if coding) are permitted.*

**Time Limit:**

You have **90 minutes** to complete the tasks and prepare your submission file.

**Tasks:**

You are required to analyze the provided `policy_data.csv` file for the **study period covering January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, inclusive.**

**Definitions for Calculations:**

*   **Exposure Calculation:** Calculate exposure in person-years. For each policy, determine the number of days the policy was active *within* the study period (January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022). Sum these days across all relevant policies and divide the total by 365.25. Report exposure rounded to **two decimal places**.
*   **Age Calculation:** For calculations involving age (specifically for age-banded analysis), use the **age attained as of January 1st** of the specific calendar year (2021 or 2022) in which the exposure occurs or the death event happens. For example, for exposure occurring during 2021, use age as of 2021-01-01. For a death occurring in 2022, use age as of 2022-01-01.
*   **Death Identification:** A death event corresponds to records where the `status` column is exactly equal to 'Death' and the `policy_end_date` falls within the study period (January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, inclusive).

**Perform the following calculations:**

1.  **Total Exposure:** Calculate the total exposure (in person-years, rounded to 2 decimal places) for all policyholders across the entire study period (2021-2022).
2.  **Total Deaths:** Count the total number of deaths occurring within the study period.
3.  **Crude Mortality Rate:** Calculate the crude mortality rate for the study period (Total Deaths / Total Exposure). Report this rate rounded to **six decimal places**.
4.  **Age Band 1 Analysis (Ages 40-59):**
    *   Calculate the total exposure (person-years, rounded to 2 decimal places) contributed during the study period by policyholders who were aged 40 to 59 (inclusive) based on the Age Calculation definition above.
    *   Count the total number of deaths occurring during the study period for policyholders who were aged 40 to 59 (inclusive) at the time of death, based on the Age Calculation definition above.
    *   Calculate the mortality rate for this age band (Deaths / Exposure). Report this rate rounded to **six decimal places**.
5.  **Age Band 2 Analysis (Ages 60-79):**
    *   Calculate the total exposure (person-years, rounded to 2 decimal places) contributed during the study period by policyholders who were aged 60 to 79 (inclusive) based on the Age Calculation definition above.
    *   Count the total number of deaths occurring during the study period for policyholders who were aged 60 to 79 (inclusive) at the time of death, based on the Age Calculation definition above.
    *   Calculate the mortality rate for this age band (Deaths / Exposure). Report this rate rounded to **six decimal places**.

**Submission Instructions:**

You must submit your answers in a single JSON file named `test_submission.json`. The file must contain a single JSON object with the following structure and keys. Use the exact key names provided. Ensure numerical values are numbers, not strings, and adhere to the specified rounding.

```json
{
  ""total_exposure"": 0.00,
  ""total_deaths"": 0,

    ""exposure"": 0.00,
    ""deaths"": 0,
    ""mortality_rate"": 0.000000
  }
}
```

**Example Placeholder Values (replace with your calculated results):**

```json

    ""exposure"": 4321.98,
    ""deaths"": 45,
    ""mortality_rate"": 0.010412
  }
}
```

**Important Notes:**

*   Ensure you use *only* the provided `policy_data.csv` file.
*   Adhere strictly to the definitions provided for Exposure Calculation, Age Calculation, and Death Identification.
*   Double-check that your submission file is named `test_submission.json` and matches the specified JSON structure exactly, including key names and data types.

Okay, here is the specification for the candidate's submission format.

---

**Submission Format Specification**

**1. File Name:**

*   Your submission **must** be a single file named exactly `test_submission.json`.

**2. File Content:**

*   The file must contain a single JSON object.
*   This JSON object must include a `candidate_id` field and fields for each calculated result, structured exactly as shown below.

**3. Candidate ID:**

*   Include a top-level key named `candidate_id`.
*   The value for this key should be a string representing your assigned candidate identifier. Replace `""YOUR_ID_HERE""` with the specific ID provided to you (e.g., `""GPT-4o""`, `""Claude-3_7-Sonnet""`, etc.).

**4. JSON Structure and Answer Format:**

*   Use the exact key names specified below (these act as the identifiers for each answer).
*   Ensure all numerical values are represented as JSON numbers (not strings).
*   Adhere strictly to the specified number of decimal places for each numerical value. Integer values should be represented as whole numbers without decimal points.

```json
{
  ""candidate_id"": ""YOUR_ID_HERE"",
  ""total_exposure"": 0.00,            // Number, rounded to exactly 2 decimal places (e.g., 12345.67)
  ""total_deaths"": 0,                 // Integer (e.g., 89)
  ""crude_mortality_rate"": 0.000000,  // Number, rounded to exactly 6 decimal places (e.g., 0.007201)
  ""age_band_40_59"": {
    ""exposure"": 0.00,                // Number, rounded to exactly 2 decimal places (e.g., 5432.10)
    ""deaths"": 0,                     // Integer (e.g., 15)
    ""mortality_rate"": 0.000000      // Number, rounded to exactly 6 decimal places (e.g., 0.002761)
  },
  ""age_band_60_79"": {
    ""exposure"": 0.00,                // Number, rounded to exactly 2 decimal places (e.g., 4321.98)
    ""deaths"": 0,                     // Integer (e.g., 45)
    ""mortality_rate"": 0.000000      // Number, rounded to exactly 6 decimal places (e.g., 0.010412)
  }
}
```

**5. Units:**

*   Exposure values (`total_exposure`, `age_band_40_59.exposure`, `age_band_60_79.exposure`) represent person-years.
*   Death counts (`total_deaths`, `age_band_40_59.deaths`, `age_band_60_79.deaths`) represent the number of deaths.
*   Mortality rates (`crude_mortality_rate`, `age_band_40_59.mortality_rate`, `age_band_60_79.mortality_rate`) are rates (deaths per person-year of exposure).
*   Do not include units (like ""person-years"") within the JSON values themselves; only provide the numerical results formatted as specified.

**6. Supplementary Files:**

*   No supplementary files (e.g., code files, spreadsheets) are required or permitted for submission. Only the `test_submission.json` file will be evaluated.

**Example (Illustrative Only - Do NOT submit these values):**

```json

```

**Ensure your final `test_submission.json` file is valid JSON and strictly adheres to this format.**","You are an excellent examiner of Actuaries capabilities. Design a remote, **practical** exam to verify whether a Actuaries can Analyze statistical information to estimate mortality, accident, sickness, disability, and retirement rates..

    ### Context
    - The candidate has access to a computer with the following tools: Coding, Spreadsheets, Text editor and PDF viewer
    - The candidate can also be given digital materials such as Text or Data that must be used for the test.
    - Design a **practical** exam that can be completed remotely using only these tools. A practical exam is an exam actually testing whether the described task can be performed successfully. An exam testing knowledge about the task is NOT a practical exam.
    - To simplify evaluation, the candidate should submit answers in a structured JSON format. Name the file ""test_submission.json"".
    - The candidate should be able to complete the exam in maximum 90 minutes.
    ","Okay, here is the design for the **Basic Level Practical Exam** focusing on analyzing statistical information to estimate mortality rates.

## Examiner Explanation: Basic Practical Exam Design

**Exam Purpose:**

This basic practical exam aims to assess a candidate's fundamental ability to process raw data, calculate exposure, identify relevant decrements (deaths), and compute basic mortality rates. It tests the practical application of core actuarial techniques in a controlled, remote environment, moving beyond theoretical knowledge to actual execution. The focus is on accurate data handling and calculation using standard tools.

**Exam Structure:**

1.  **Scenario & Data:** The candidate receives a brief scenario description (e.g., analyzing a small life insurance portfolio) and a dataset (`policy_data.csv`). The dataset contains anonymized policyholder information including ID, date of birth, policy start date, policy end date (or study end date if still active), and status/reason for exit (e.g., 'In Force', 'Death', 'Lapse').
2.  **Tasks:** The candidate is instructed to perform specific calculations for a defined study period (e.g., Calendar Years 2021-2022):
    *   Calculate the total **exposure** (in person-years) for the study period using a specified simple method (e.g., exact days within the period, summed and divided by 365.25).
    *   Identify and count the total number of **deaths** occurring within the study period.
    *   Calculate the **crude mortality rate** (total deaths / total exposure).
    *   Calculate the exposure, deaths, and mortality rate for **two specified age bands** (e.g., Ages 40-59, Ages 60-79) based on age at the start of the calendar year of exposure or event.
3.  **Tools:** Candidates use their choice of spreadsheets or coding (Python/R recommended) to perform the analysis. A text editor is needed to structure the final JSON output. A PDF viewer is needed for instructions.
4.  **Deliverable:** A single JSON file named `test_submission.json` containing the calculated results in a predefined structure. This allows for efficient and consistent evaluation.
5.  **Time Limit:** 90 minutes.

**Why it's Practical:**

*   Requires direct manipulation and analysis of raw data, not just recalling formulas.
*   Involves calculating fundamental actuarial metrics (exposure, rates).
*   Tests proficiency with common data analysis tools (spreadsheets/coding).
*   Simulates a simplified version of a real-world task.

**Why it's Basic:**

*   Uses a relatively small, clean dataset.
*   Focuses on a single decrement (mortality).
*   Requires calculation of crude rates and simple age-banded rates, avoiding complex graduation or modeling.
*   Specifies a straightforward exposure calculation method.

---

**(Self-Correction Note for Examiner:** The next step would be to generate the detailed instructions PDF, the `policy_data.csv` file, and the precise JSON schema for the `test_submission.json` file, which are not part of this current task but would be required to actually administer the exam).","Okay, here are the candidate instructions for the Basic Practical Exam.

## Actuarial Practical Exam: Basic Level - Mortality Analysis

**Welcome, Candidate.**

This practical exam assesses your ability to analyze basic statistical information to estimate mortality rates using standard tools. You will be working with a provided dataset to calculate key actuarial metrics.

**Exam Objective:**

Your goal is to process a dataset of policyholder information, calculate exposure and deaths according to specified definitions, and determine crude and age-banded mortality rates for a defined study period. This task requires practical application of data handling and calculation skills.

**Provided Materials:**

You will be provided with the following digital file:

1.  **`policy_data.csv`**: A comma-separated value file containing anonymized policyholder data. Key columns include:
    *   `policy_id`: Unique identifier for each policyholder.
    *   `date_of_birth`: Date of birth of the policyholder (YYYY-MM-DD).
    *   `policy_start_date`: Date the policy became active (YYYY-MM-DD).
    *   `policy_end_date`: Date the policy ended or the study observation ended (YYYY-MM-DD).
    *   `status`: Reason for the policy ending or its status at `policy_end_date` (e.g., 'In Force', 'Death', 'Lapse').

**Available Tools:**

You are permitted to use the following tools on your computer:

*   Spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc)
*   Coding environment (e.g., Python with pandas/numpy, R with dplyr/data.table)
*   A simple Text Editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code, Sublime Text) for creating the JSON submission file.
*   A PDF Viewer for reading these instructions.

*No other tools or external resources (including internet search beyond accessing standard library documentation if coding) are permitted.*

**Time Limit:**

You have **90 minutes** to complete the tasks and prepare your submission file.

**Tasks:**

You are required to analyze the provided `policy_data.csv` file for the **study period covering January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, inclusive.**

**Definitions for Calculations:**

*   **Exposure Calculation:** Calculate exposure in person-years. For each policy, determine the number of days the policy was active *within* the study period (January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022). Sum these days across all relevant policies and divide the total by 365.25. Report exposure rounded to **two decimal places**.
*   **Age Calculation:** For calculations involving age (specifically for age-banded analysis), use the **age attained as of January 1st** of the specific calendar year (2021 or 2022) in which the exposure occurs or the death event happens. For example, for exposure occurring during 2021, use age as of 2021-01-01. For a death occurring in 2022, use age as of 2022-01-01.
*   **Death Identification:** A death event corresponds to records where the `status` column is exactly equal to 'Death' and the `policy_end_date` falls within the study period (January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, inclusive).

**Perform the following calculations:**

1.  **Total Exposure:** Calculate the total exposure (in person-years, rounded to 2 decimal places) for all policyholders across the entire study period (2021-2022).
2.  **Total Deaths:** Count the total number of deaths occurring within the study period.
3.  **Crude Mortality Rate:** Calculate the crude mortality rate for the study period (Total Deaths / Total Exposure). Report this rate rounded to **six decimal places**.
4.  **Age Band 1 Analysis (Ages 40-59):**
    *   Calculate the total exposure (person-years, rounded to 2 decimal places) contributed during the study period by policyholders who were aged 40 to 59 (inclusive) based on the Age Calculation definition above.
    *   Count the total number of deaths occurring during the study period for policyholders who were aged 40 to 59 (inclusive) at the time of death, based on the Age Calculation definition above.
    *   Calculate the mortality rate for this age band (Deaths / Exposure). Report this rate rounded to **six decimal places**.
5.  **Age Band 2 Analysis (Ages 60-79):**
    *   Calculate the total exposure (person-years, rounded to 2 decimal places) contributed during the study period by policyholders who were aged 60 to 79 (inclusive) based on the Age Calculation definition above.
    *   Count the total number of deaths occurring during the study period for policyholders who were aged 60 to 79 (inclusive) at the time of death, based on the Age Calculation definition above.
    *   Calculate the mortality rate for this age band (Deaths / Exposure). Report this rate rounded to **six decimal places**.

```
*Filename: `policy_data.csv`*
</MATERIALS_FOR_CANDIDATE>

<MATERIALS_EXPLANATION_FOR_EVALUATOR>
**1. How Materials Were Created:**

*   The `policy_data.csv` file contains 20 synthetic records representing individual life insurance policies.
*   The data was constructed to test specific aspects of exposure and mortality rate calculation within the defined study period (Jan 1, 2021 - Dec 31, 2022).
*   Dates (`date_of_birth`, `policy_start_date`, `policy_end_date`) were chosen strategically to create various scenarios relative to the study period and age band boundaries.
*   The `status` column ('In Force', 'Death', 'Lapse') determines the type of decrement (if any) and whether a record contributes to the death count.
*   The number of records is small enough to be manageable within the time limit but large enough to require systematic processing (discouraging manual calculation for everything).
*   Records were designed to fall into, outside of, and across the specified age bands (40-59, 60-79) based on the ""age as of Jan 1st of the year"" rule.

**2. Statistical Patterns and Relationships:**

*   There are no intentionally hidden complex statistical patterns (like trends or seasonality) in this basic dataset.
*   The distribution of ages and entry/exit dates is artificial, designed purely to test the calculation mechanics.
*   Mortality rates derived from this small dataset are not intended to be realistic but serve as verifiable calculation outputs.

**3. Cross-References:**

*   The core task involves relating `policy_start_date` and `policy_end_date` to the study period (2021-01-01 to 2022-12-31) to calculate exposure days.
*   `date_of_birth` must be used to calculate the age as of Jan 1st of the relevant year (2021 or 2022) for age-banding exposure and deaths.
*   The `status` column must be checked *in conjunction with* the `policy_end_date` falling within the study period to identify countable deaths.

**4. Tricky Elements and Common Pitfalls:**

*   **Exposure Calculation:**
    *   Incorrectly handling the start/end dates of the exposure interval within the study period (e.g., off-by-one errors, not clipping dates to the study period boundaries).
    *   Forgetting to divide total days by 365.25.
    *   Incorrectly calculating days (e.g., not handling date math precisely, especially across year-end).
*   **Age Calculation:**
    *   Using age at policy start, age at policy end, or age at birthday instead of the specified ""age as of Jan 1st of the year of exposure/event"".
    *   Misallocating exposure for policies that cross age bands during the study period (e.g., ID 4: Age 59 in 2021, Age 60 in 2022. Exposure for 2021 belongs to 40-59 band, exposure for 2022 belongs to 60-79 band).
*   **Death Identification:**
    *   Counting deaths where `policy_end_date` is outside the study period.
    *   Counting non-'Death' statuses (e.g., 'Lapse') as deaths.
    *   Assigning the death to the wrong age band if the age calculation is incorrect.
*   **Filtering:**
    *   Failing to exclude records entirely outside the study period (ID 14, ID 15).
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Policies starting/ending exactly on study period boundaries (ID 6, 8, 9, 10, 16, 18, 19, 20) require careful comparison logic (`>=`, `<=`).
    *   Policy ID 17 has a Feb 29 DOB, which is irrelevant to the age calculation method but might cause confusion.
*   **Rounding:** Applying rounding incorrectly or at intermediate steps.
*   **JSON Format:** Errors in the final JSON structure, key names, or data types (e.g., numbers as strings).

**5. ""Hidden"" Information:**

*   The most crucial ""hidden"" element is the implication of the ""Age as of Jan 1st of the year"" rule combined with the ""Exposure Calculation"" rule. For a policy active across both 2021 and 2022 (like ID 4), the exposure contributed in 2021 must be calculated based on age at 2021-01-01, and the exposure contributed in 2022 must be calculated based on age at 2022-01-01. This requires splitting the exposure calculation by calendar year for age-banding purposes, even if not explicitly stated as a separate step. Candidates who calculate total exposure first and then try to assign it based on a single age point will likely get the age-banded exposures wrong for records like ID 4.

By correctly applying the definitions and handling these potential pitfalls, the candidate should arrive at unique, verifiable numerical answers for the JSON submission.

    ""mortality_rate"": 0.000000      // Number, rounded to exactly 6 decimal places (e.g., 0.010412)
  }
}
```

**5. Units:**

*   Exposure values (`total_exposure`, `age_band_40_59.exposure`, `age_band_60_79.exposure`) represent person-years.
*   Death counts (`total_deaths`, `age_band_40_59.deaths`, `age_band_60_79.deaths`) represent the number of deaths.
*   Mortality rates (`crude_mortality_rate`, `age_band_40_59.mortality_rate`, `age_band_60_79.mortality_rate`) are rates (deaths per person-year of exposure).
*   Do not include units (like ""person-years"") within the JSON values themselves; only provide the numerical results formatted as specified.

**6. Supplementary Files:**

*   No supplementary files (e.g., code files, spreadsheets) are required or permitted for submission. Only the `test_submission.json` file will be evaluated.

**Example (Illustrative Only - Do NOT submit these values):**

```json
{
  ""candidate_id"": ""ExampleCandidate-001"",
  ""total_exposure"": 12345.67,
  ""total_deaths"": 89,
  ""crude_mortality_rate"": 0.007201,
  ""age_band_40_59"": {
    ""exposure"": 5432.10,
    ""deaths"": 15,
    ""mortality_rate"": 0.002761
  },
  ""age_band_60_79"": {
    ""exposure"": 4321.98,
    ""deaths"": 45,
    ""mortality_rate"": 0.010412
  }
}
```

**Ensure your final `test_submission.json` file is valid JSON and strictly adheres to this format.**","Okay, here are the evaluator materials for the Basic Practical Exam, including the answer key, explanation, and passing criteria.

## Evaluator Materials: Basic Practical Exam

**1. Answer Key (`test_submission.json` format)**

This is the expected content of the candidate's `test_submission.json` file, assuming a placeholder `candidate_id`. Automated checking should compare the candidate's submitted values against these, allowing for standard floating-point comparisons where appropriate.

```json
{
  ""candidate_id"": ""EXPECTED_SOLUTION"",
  ""total_exposure"": 20.56,
  ""total_deaths"": 8,
  ""crude_mortality_rate"": 0.389082,
  ""age_band_40_59"": {
    ""exposure"": 8.33,
    ""deaths"": 2,
    ""mortality_rate"": 0.240132
  },
  ""age_band_60_79"": {
    ""exposure"": 9.40,
    ""deaths"": 6,
    ""mortality_rate"": 0.638356
  }
}
```

**2. Explanation of Correct Answers and Derivation**

The following steps detail how the correct answers are derived from the provided `policy_data.csv` based on the candidate instructions.

**A. Study Period:** January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2022 (inclusive).

**B. Core Definitions:**
    *   **Exposure:** Days active within the study period / 365.25.
    *   **Age:** Age attained as of January 1st of the calendar year (2021 or 2022) in which exposure occurs or death happens.
    *   **Death:** `status` is 'Death' and `policy_end_date` is within the study period.

**C. Processing Each Policy:**

*   **Study Period Dates:** `study_start = 2021-01-01`, `study_end = 2022-12-31`
*   **Days Divisor:** 365.25

*Notes on Calculation:*
*   Days calculation includes both start and end date: `(end_date - start_date).days + 1`.
*   Age calculation: `floor((reference_date - dob).days / 365.25)`. Reference date is Jan 1st of the relevant year.
*   Exposure days are split between 2021 and 2022 based on the policy's active period within each year.
*   Age banding for exposure is based on the age for *that specific year*. (e.g., ID 4: 2021 exposure uses Age 59 -> Band 40-59; 2022 exposure uses Age 60 -> Band 60-79).
*   Age banding for death is based on the age as of Jan 1st of the year the death occurred.

**D. Aggregation:**

*   **Total Exposure Days:** Sum of 'Total Exp Days' column = 7510 days
*   **Total Deaths:** Count 'Yes' in 'Death in Period?' column = 8 deaths (IDs: 2, 5, 7, 9, 13, 16, 19, 20)

*   **Age Band 40-59 Exposure Days:**
    *   ID 1: 365 (2021) + 365 (2022) = 730
    *   ID 4: 365 (2021 only) = 365
    *   ID 8: 365 (2021) + 365 (2022) = 730
    *   ID 9: 365 (2021 only) = 365
    *   ID 10: 365 (2022 only) = 365
    *   ID 12: 121 (2021 only) = 121
    *   ID 18: 365 (2021 only) = 365
    *   ID 20: 1 (2021 only) = 1
    *   Total = 730 + 365 + 730 + 365 + 365 + 121 + 365 + 1 = 3042 days

*   **Age Band 40-59 Deaths:**
    *   ID 9 (Age 55) = 1
    *   ID 20 (Age 57) = 1
    *   Total = 2 deaths

*   **Age Band 60-79 Exposure Days:**
    *   ID 2: 365 (2021) + 181 (2022) = 546
    *   ID 4: 365 (2022 only) = 365
    *   ID 5: 196 (2021 only) = 196
    *   ID 7: 288 (2022 only) = 288
    *   ID 13: 153 (2021) + 59 (2022) = 212
    *   ID 16: 365 (2021) + 365 (2022) = 730
    *   ID 17: 365 (2021) + 365 (2022) = 730
    *   ID 19: 365 (2021) + 1 (2022) = 366
    *   Total = 546 + 365 + 196 + 288 + 212 + 730 + 730 + 366 = 3433 days

*   **Age Band 60-79 Deaths:**
    *   ID 2 (Age 66) = 1
    *   ID 5 (Age 75) = 1
    *   ID 7 (Age 72) = 1
    *   ID 13 (Age 63) = 1
    *   ID 16 (Age 69) = 1
    *   ID 19 (Age 79) = 1
    *   Total = 6 deaths

**E. Final Calculations and Rounding:**

*   `total_exposure` = 7510 / 365.25 = 20.561259... -> **20.56** (rounded to 2 dp)
*   `total_deaths` = **8** (integer)
*   `crude_mortality_rate` = 8 / 20.561259... = 0.3890815... -> **0.389082** (rounded to 6 dp)

*   `age_band_40_59.exposure` = 3042 / 365.25 = 8.328542... -> **8.33** (rounded to 2 dp)
*   `age_band_40_59.deaths` = **2** (integer)
*   `age_band_40_59.mortality_rate` = 2 / 8.328542... = 0.240131... -> **0.240132** (rounded to 6 dp)

*   `age_band_60_79.exposure` = 3433 / 365.25 = 9.399041... -> **9.40** (rounded to 2 dp)
*   `age_band_60_79.deaths` = **6** (integer)
*   `age_band_60_79.mortality_rate` = 6 / 9.399041... = 0.638356... -> **0.638356** (rounded to 6 dp)

**3. Passing Criteria**

This is a basic exam focused on fundamental calculations and data handling. The candidate needs to demonstrate proficiency in applying the specified methods accurately.

*   **Minimum Requirement for Pass:**
    *   The submission MUST be a valid JSON file named `test_submission.json` with the correct structure and key names. Failure here indicates an inability to follow instructions and results in a fail.
    *   The `candidate_id` field must be present (value doesn't affect pass/fail but is needed for tracking).
    *   At least **6 out of the 8** numerical values must be exactly correct (matching the answer key after specified rounding). This allows for one significant calculation error (e.g., misinterpreting the age definition affecting one age band) or a couple of minor rounding/transcription errors, while still requiring demonstrated competence in the core tasks.

*   **Rationale:**
    *   Getting `total_exposure` and `total_deaths` correct shows basic data filtering and aggregation ability.
    *   Getting the age-banded figures correct demonstrates understanding of the more complex age definition and exposure allocation logic (especially handling records like ID 4 that cross bands).
    *   Requiring 6/8 correct ensures the candidate has successfully executed most parts of the analysis.
    *   Strict adherence to the JSON format is crucial for automated processing and reflects the need for precision in actuarial work.

*   **Distinction / Higher Marks (If applicable):**
    *   8 out of 8 numerical values correct + correct format = Full Marks / Excellent.
    *   7 out of 8 numerical values correct + correct format = Good / Minor Error.
    *   6 out of 8 numerical values correct + correct format = Pass / Basic Competence Demonstrated.
    *   Less than 6 correct values OR incorrect JSON format = Fail.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import Libraries:** Imports `json` for handling JSON data, `argparse` for command-line arguments, `sys` for error output and exit, `os` for file path checks, and `Decimal` for accurate numerical comparison.
2.  **`load_json_file(filepath)`:**
    *   Takes a file path as input.
    *   Checks if the file exists using `os.path.exists`.
    *   Uses a `try-except` block to open the file, load the JSON data using `json.load()`.
    *   Handles potential `FileNotFoundError`, `json.JSONDecodeError`, and other file reading exceptions, printing an error message to `stderr` and exiting the script.
    *   Returns the loaded data (usually a dictionary).
3.  **`compare_values(submitted_val, expected_val, key_path_str)`:**
    *   Compares a single submitted value against the expected value.
    *   Checks if the expected value is numeric. If so, it verifies the submitted value is also numeric.
    *   Uses the `Decimal` type for comparison to avoid floating-point inaccuracies, especially important when specific rounding is required. It converts both values to `Decimal` before comparing.
    *   Includes a commented-out section that could be enabled for a *very strict* check on the exact number of decimal places (by comparing `Decimal.as_tuple().exponent`). The current implementation focuses on value equality after potential rounding.
    *   Returns `True` if values match according to the rules, `False` otherwise. Includes warnings for type mismatches or conversion errors.
4.  **`main()` Function:**
    *   **Argument Parsing:** Sets up `argparse` to accept the submission file and answer key file paths as positional arguments.
    *   **Load Data:** Calls `load_json_file` for both input files.
    *   **Basic Structure Validation:** Performs essential checks to ensure the submission file has the required top-level keys (`candidate_id`, etc.) and that the nested age band keys exist and are dictionaries. If the basic structure is invalid, it prints an error, saves a minimal `test_results.json` indicating the format failure, and exits.
    *   **Detailed Comparison Setup:**
        *   Initializes the `results` dictionary to store detailed comparison outcomes and summary statistics.
        *   Defines `keys_to_check`: A list containing the exact keys (or tuples for nested keys) that need to be compared against the answer key for scoring. This ensures only relevant fields are checked.
        *   Initializes `correct_count` and `total_checked`.
    *   **Comparison Loop:**
        *   Iterates through `keys_to_check`.
        *   Safely retrieves the submitted and expected values using `.get()` to handle potentially missing keys gracefully. Nested keys are accessed using the tuple structure `(dict_key, nested_key)`.
        *   Calls `compare_values` to determine if the values match.
        *   Handles cases where keys are missing in the submission or (unexpectedly) in the answer key.
        *   Increments `correct_count` if the comparison is successful.
        *   Stores the submitted value, expected value, and correctness status (`True`/`False`) in the `results[""comparison_details""]` dictionary.
    *   **Calculate Score & Finalize:**
        *   Calculates the `overall_score` as a percentage (`correct_count / total_checked * 100`).
        *   Adds the summary statistics (`correct_answers`, `total_fields_checked`) and the calculated `overall_score` (rounded to 2 decimal places) to the `results` dictionary.
        *   Adds a `result_status` (""Pass"" or ""Fail"") based on the defined passing criteria (minimum 6 correct answers out of 9 checked fields).
    *   **Save Results:**
        *   Opens `test_results.json` for writing.
        *   Uses `json.dump()` with `indent=4` to write the `results` dictionary to the file in a readable format.
        *   Prints a confirmation message to the console.
        *   Includes error handling for writing the output file.
5.  **`if __name__ == ""__main__"":`:** Ensures the `main()` function is called only when the script is executed directly.

**To Use:**

1.  Save the code above as `task_evaluation.py`.
2.  Make sure you have the candidate's submission file (e.g., `test_submission.json`) and the corresponding answer key file (e.g., `answer_key.json`) in the same directory or provide the correct paths.
3.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python task_evaluation.py test_submission.json answer_key.json
    ```
    (Replace `test_submission.json` and `answer_key.json` with the actual filenames if they are different).
4.  The script will print status messages and potential warnings/errors to the console.
5.  A `test_results.json` file will be created in the same directory, containing the detailed evaluation and the overall score.","{'candidate_id': 'EXPECTED_SOLUTION', 'total_exposure': 20.56, 'total_deaths': 8, 'crude_mortality_rate': 0.389082, 'age_band_40_59': {'exposure': 8.33, 'deaths': 2, 'mortality_rate': 0.240132}, 'age_band_60_79': {'exposure': 9.4, 'deaths': 6, 'mortality_rate': 0.638356}}",[],True,True,0.0,99.0,100.0,1.0,False,"Could not parse JSON.

However, it doesn't strictly enforce the *exact* number of trailing decimal places specified in the instructions (e.g., it would likely accept `9.4` where `9.40` is specified). This might be acceptable but differs slightly from the strict instruction wording.\n3.  **Passing Threshold:** The 6/9 threshold allows a candidate to pass even if they make significant errors in the more complex age-banding calculations (e.g., getting both age-band rates wrong), as long as they get the totals and some components correct. This might be slightly lenient, potentially allowing a pass without fully demonstrating competence in age-specific analysis.\n4.  **Answer Key Format:** Minor inconsistency where the answer key JSON shows `9.4` while the derivation implies `9.40` for `age_band_60_79.exposure`.

## Basic Data Preparation Practical Exam Instructions

**Objective:**

Your task is to perform basic data preparation on a set of provided data files. This involves loading and combining data, identifying common data quality issues, cleaning and adjusting the data according to specific rules, and applying pre-defined weights.

**Duration:**

You have a maximum of **90 minutes** to complete this exam.

**Allowed Tools:**

You may use any combination of the following tools installed on your computer:
*   A coding environment (e.g., Python with libraries like Pandas, R with relevant packages)
*   Spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc)
*   A text editor

**Provided Materials:**

You will be provided with the following digital files:

1.  **`customer_info.csv`**: A CSV file containing customer demographic information (e.g., CustomerID, Age, Gender, Region).
2.  **`survey_responses.txt`**: A text file containing survey responses (e.g., ResponseID, CustomerID, SurveyDate, Score). **Note:** This file is tab-separated (TSV).
3.  **`region_weights.csv`**: A CSV file mapping geographic regions to numerical weighting factors.

**Submission Format:**

You must submit your answers in a single JSON file named `test_submission.json`. The file must follow the exact structure specified below. Replace placeholder values (like `<integer>`, `<float>`, `[""value1"", ...]`, `""Candidate_XYZ""`, `""YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ""`) with your actual results and information. Ensure numerical values are reported as numbers (not strings) and adhere to any specified rounding rules.

**Exam Tasks:**

Perform the following tasks sequentially. Use the output of the previous task as the input for the next, where applicable.

**Task 1: Load and Combine Data**

*   Load the data from `customer_info.csv` and `survey_responses.txt` (remember it's tab-separated).
*   Ensure the `CustomerID` column is treated consistently across both datasets to allow for accurate merging (pay attention to potential differences like data types or leading characters).
*   Merge the two datasets based on `CustomerID`. Keep only the records that have a matching `CustomerID` in **both** files (an inner join).
*   **Deliverable:** Report the total number of rows and columns in the resulting merged dataset. Populate the `task_1_load_combine` section of your `test_submission.json`.

**Task 2: Identify Data Issues**

*   Using the merged dataset created in Task 1, identify the following:
    *   The total count of missing values (e.g., NaN, null, blank cells, empty strings) in the `Age` column.
    *   The total count of missing values in the `Score` column.
    *   All unique values present in the `Gender` column *before* any cleaning or standardization. Report these as a list of strings, sorted alphabetically.
    *   The number of rows where the original `Age` value is greater than 100.
    *   The number of complete duplicate rows present in the merged dataset.
*   **Deliverable:** Report the requested counts and the list of unique gender values. Populate the `task_2_identify_issues` section of your `test_submission.json`.

**Task 3: Clean and Adjust Data**

*   Perform the following cleaning and adjustment steps on the merged dataset:
    *   **Remove Duplicates:** Remove the complete duplicate rows identified in Task 2. Use the dataset *after* duplicate removal for subsequent steps.
    *   **Handle Missing Age:** Calculate the median `Age` using only the non-missing `Age` values from the dataset *after* removing duplicates but *before* handling high age values (Task 3d). Fill any missing `Age` values with this calculated median.
    *   **Handle Missing Score:** Fill any missing `Score` values with the numerical value `0`.
    *   **Standardize Gender:** Convert all values in the `Gender` column to one of the following standard categories: `""Male""`, `""Female""`, `""Other""`. Map recognizable variations (e.g., ""M"", ""male"", ""F"", ""female"") appropriately. Any value that is not clearly identifiable as male or female should be mapped to `""Other""`.
    *   **Adjust High Age:** For any rows where the original `Age` was greater than 100 (as identified in Task 2), change the `Age` value to exactly `100`.
    *   **Format Survey Date:** Convert the `SurveyDate` column to a consistent `""YYYY-MM-DD""` string format. If a date value cannot be reliably converted to this format, represent it as a missing value (null/NA). Count how many rows resulted in a missing value after attempting conversion.
*   **Deliverable:** After applying *all* the cleaning steps above, report:
    *   The total number of rows remaining in the dataset.
    *   The median `Age` of the cleaned dataset (rounded to 1 decimal place).
    *   The mean `Score` of the cleaned dataset (rounded to 2 decimal places).
    *   The count of rows where `SurveyDate` conversion failed and resulted in a missing value.
    *   Populate the `task_3_clean_adjust` section of your `test_submission.json`.

**Task 4: Apply Weights**

*   Load the `region_weights.csv` file. This file contains `Region` and `Weight` columns.
*   Merge the weights onto your cleaned dataset from Task 3, matching based on the `Region` column.
*   For any rows in your main dataset whose `Region` does not have a corresponding entry in `region_weights.csv`, use a default `Weight` of `1.0`.
*   Create a new column named `WeightedScore`. Calculate its value by multiplying the cleaned `Score` (from Task 3) by the corresponding `Weight` (either from the file or the default 1.0).
*   **Deliverable:** Calculate the mean of the newly created `WeightedScore` column across all rows in the final dataset. Report this value rounded to 2 decimal places. Populate the `task_4_apply_weights` section of your `test_submission.json`.

## Basic Data Preparation Practical Exam Design

### 1. Exam Purpose and Structure (For Evaluator)

*   **Purpose:** This exam assesses a candidate's fundamental ability to perform basic data preparation tasks using common tools. It focuses on the practical application of skills required to transform raw data into a usable format for analysis. The key skills tested are: organizing information (loading, merging, selecting), checking for inaccuracies (identifying missing values, inconsistencies, outliers, duplicates), and adjusting raw data (handling missing values, correcting formats, standardizing categories, basic outlier treatment). Applying pre-defined weights is also included as a basic adjustment task.
*   **Structure:** The exam presents a realistic scenario involving raw data files. The candidate must perform a series of sequential tasks, starting with loading and combining data, then identifying and reporting issues, followed by cleaning and adjusting the data according to specific instructions, and finally applying provided weights.
*   **Methodology:** The candidate will be provided with several small data files (e.g., CSV, TXT) containing typical data quality issues. They will use their choice of coding tools (like Python with Pandas, or R), spreadsheet software, or a text editor to perform the tasks. The emphasis is on achieving the correct outcome, regardless of the specific tool, although coding is often more efficient.
*   **Evaluation:** Assessment is based on the accuracy and completeness of the results submitted in the structured `test_submission.json` file. This file will contain specific outputs requested at the end of each task (e.g., counts of missing values, summary statistics of cleaned data, specific calculated values). The structure allows for straightforward, potentially automated, checking against expected results.
*   **Time Limit:** 90 minutes.

### 2. Exam Materials Provided to Candidate

1.  **Instructions Document (`instructions.md`):**
    *   Explains the scenario (e.g., preparing customer survey data).
    *   Details the tasks to be performed.
    *   Specifies the tools allowed (Coding environment, Spreadsheet software, Text editor).
    *   States the time limit (90 minutes).
    *   Provides the required JSON submission format (`test_submission.json`).
    *   Lists the data files provided and gives brief descriptions of their expected content.
2.  **Data Files:**
    *   `customer_info.csv`: Contains basic customer demographics (CustomerID, Age, Gender, Region). May contain missing values, inconsistent gender entries (""M"", ""Male"", ""female""), and potentially an outlier age. CustomerID format might vary slightly (e.g., leading zeros).
    *   `survey_responses.txt`: A tab-separated file (TSV disguised as TXT) containing survey responses (ResponseID, CustomerID, SurveyDate, Score). May contain missing scores, dates in inconsistent formats (e.g., ""YYYY-MM-DD"", ""MM/DD/YY""), and duplicate responses. CustomerID might be stored as text.
    *   `region_weights.csv`: A simple CSV mapping Region to a numerical Weight factor (Region, Weight).

### 3. Exam Tasks & Expected JSON Output Structure

**(Instructions to Candidate within `instructions.md`)**

**Scenario:** You have received data from a recent customer survey. Your task is to prepare this data for a preliminary analysis by cleaning and structuring it.

**Tools:** You may use coding tools (Python/R), spreadsheet software (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.), or a text editor.

**Submission:** Submit a single JSON file named `test_submission.json` containing the results specified for each task.

---

**Task 1: Load and Combine Data**

*   **Description:** Load the `customer_info.csv` and `survey_responses.txt` files. Ensure `CustomerID` is treated consistently for merging (e.g., handle potential leading zeros or data type differences). Merge the two datasets based on `CustomerID` to create a single dataset containing information from both files. Keep only records present in *both* files (inner join).
*   **Deliverable:** Report the number of rows and columns in the final merged dataset.
*   **JSON Output Section:**
    ```json
    ""task_1_load_combine"": {
      ""merged_rows"": <integer>,
      ""merged_columns"": <integer>
    }
    ```

**Task 2: Identify Data Issues**

*   **Description:** Using the merged dataset from Task 1, identify the following potential issues:
    *   Count the total number of missing values (NaNs, nulls, empty strings) in the `Age` column.
    *   Count the total number of missing values in the `Score` column.
    *   List all unique values found in the `Gender` column *before* any cleaning.
    *   Identify any rows where `Age` is greater than 100. Report the count of such rows.
    *   Identify and count the number of complete duplicate rows in the merged dataset.
*   **Deliverable:** Report the counts and list requested.
*   **JSON Output Section:**
    ```json
    ""task_2_identify_issues"": {
      ""missing_age_count"": <integer>,
      ""missing_score_count"": <integer>,
      ""unique_gender_values"": [""value1"", ""value2"", ...], // Sorted alphabetically
      ""high_age_rows_count"": <integer>,
      ""duplicate_rows_count"": <integer>
    }
    ```

**Task 3: Clean and Adjust Data**

*   **Description:** Perform the following cleaning steps on the merged dataset:
    *   **Handle Duplicates:** Remove the complete duplicate rows identified in Task 2.
    *   **Handle Missing Values:**
        *   Fill missing `Age` values with the *median* age of the non-missing `Age` values (calculate median *after* removing duplicates but *before* handling high ages).
        *   Fill missing `Score` values with `0`.
    *   **Standardize Gender:** Convert all variations of gender (e.g., ""M"", ""Male"", ""female"", ""F"") to standardized values: ""Male"", ""Female"", or ""Other"". Assume any value not clearly male/female is ""Other"".
    *   **Adjust Outliers:** For any rows where `Age` was initially > 100 (identified in Task 2), cap the `Age` at `100`.
    *   **Format Date:** Convert the `SurveyDate` column to a consistent ""YYYY-MM-DD"" format. If conversion fails for any date, leave it as null/NA. Report the number of rows where date conversion failed (resulted in null/NA).
*   **Deliverable:** After performing all cleaning steps, report the median `Age`, the mean `Score`, the count of rows remaining, and the count of date conversion failures.
*   **JSON Output Section:**
    ```json
    ""task_3_clean_adjust"": {
      ""final_rows_count"": <integer>,
      ""median_age_cleaned"": <float>, // Rounded to 1 decimal place
      ""mean_score_cleaned"": <float>, // Rounded to 2 decimal places
      ""date_conversion_failures"": <integer>
    }
    ```

**Task 4: Apply Weights**

*   **Description:** Load the `region_weights.csv` file. Merge these weights onto your cleaned dataset from Task 3 based on the `Region` column. Create a new column named `WeightedScore` by multiplying the cleaned `Score` column by the corresponding `Weight` factor. If a region from the main dataset is not found in the weights file, use a default weight of `1.0`.
*   **Deliverable:** Calculate and report the mean of the new `WeightedScore` column across all rows in the final dataset.
*   **JSON Output Section:**
    ```json
    ""task_4_apply_weights"": {
      ""mean_weighted_score"": <float> // Rounded to 2 decimal places
    }
    ```

---

**Exam Tasks:**

Perform the following tasks sequentially. Use the output of the previous task as the input for the next, where applicable.

**Task 1: Load and Combine Data**

*   Load the data from `customer_info.csv` and `survey_responses.txt` (remember it's tab-separated).
*   Ensure the `CustomerID` column is treated consistently across both datasets to allow for accurate merging (pay attention to potential differences like data types or leading characters).
*   Merge the two datasets based on `CustomerID`. Keep only the records that have a matching `CustomerID` in **both** files (an inner join).
*   **Deliverable:** Report the total number of rows and columns in the resulting merged dataset. Populate the `task_1_load_combine` section of your `test_submission.json`.

**Task 2: Identify Data Issues**

*   Using the merged dataset created in Task 1, identify the following:
    *   The total count of missing values (e.g., NaN, null, blank cells, empty strings) in the `Age` column.
    *   The total count of missing values in the `Score` column.
    *   All unique values present in the `Gender` column *before* any cleaning or standardization. Report these as a list of strings, sorted alphabetically.
    *   The number of rows where the original `Age` value is greater than 100.
    *   The number of complete duplicate rows present in the merged dataset.
*   **Deliverable:** Report the requested counts and the list of unique gender values. Populate the `task_2_identify_issues` section of your `test_submission.json`.

**Task 3: Clean and Adjust Data**

*   Perform the following cleaning and adjustment steps on the merged dataset:
    *   **Remove Duplicates:** Remove the complete duplicate rows identified in Task 2. Use the dataset *after* duplicate removal for subsequent steps.
    *   **Handle Missing Age:** Calculate the median `Age` using only the non-missing `Age` values from the dataset *after* removing duplicates but *before* handling high age values (Task 3d). Fill any missing `Age` values with this calculated median.
    *   **Handle Missing Score:** Fill any missing `Score` values with the numerical value `0`.
    *   **Standardize Gender:** Convert all values in the `Gender` column to one of the following standard categories: `""Male""`, `""Female""`, `""Other""`. Map recognizable variations (e.g., ""M"", ""male"", ""F"", ""female"") appropriately. Any value that is not clearly identifiable as male or female should be mapped to `""Other""`.
    *   **Adjust High Age:** For any rows where the original `Age` was greater than 100 (as identified in Task 2), change the `Age` value to exactly `100`.
    *   **Format Survey Date:** Convert the `SurveyDate` column to a consistent `""YYYY-MM-DD""` string format. If a date value cannot be reliably converted to this format, represent it as a missing value (null/NA). Count how many rows resulted in a missing value after attempting conversion.
*   **Deliverable:** After applying *all* the cleaning steps above, report:
    *   The total number of rows remaining in the dataset.
    *   The median `Age` of the cleaned dataset (rounded to 1 decimal place).
    *   The mean `Score` of the cleaned dataset (rounded to 2 decimal places).
    *   The count of rows where `SurveyDate` conversion failed and resulted in a missing value.
    *   Populate the `task_3_clean_adjust` section of your `test_submission.json`.

**Task 4: Apply Weights**

*   Load the `region_weights.csv` file. This file contains `Region` and `Weight` columns.
*   Merge the weights onto your cleaned dataset from Task 3, matching based on the `Region` column.
*   For any rows in your main dataset whose `Region` does not have a corresponding entry in `region_weights.csv`, use a default `Weight` of `1.0`.
*   Create a new column named `WeightedScore`. Calculate its value by multiplying the cleaned `Score` (from Task 3) by the corresponding `Weight` (either from the file or the default 1.0).
*   **Deliverable:** Calculate the mean of the newly created `WeightedScore` column across all rows in the final dataset. Report this value rounded to 2 decimal places. Populate the `task_4_apply_weights` section of your `test_submission.json`.

The data files were synthetically generated to contain specific, common data quality issues relevant to the basic data preparation tasks outlined in the exam. The goal is to create a controlled environment where the candidate's ability to follow instructions and apply standard cleaning techniques can be objectively measured. The data volume is small (~20 records after initial merge) to ensure completion within the 90-minute timeframe.

**2. File-Specific Details and Interconnections:**

*   **`customer_info.csv`**:
    *   `CustomerID`: Integer type. IDs 1-20 are included.
    *   `Age`: Contains two missing values (ID 5, 15) and two outliers > 100 (ID 8: 105, ID 18: 110).
    *   `Gender`: Contains variations (""Male"", ""F"", ""M"", ""female"", """", ""Other"", ""N/A""). The empty string (ID 11) and ""N/A"" (ID 19) should be mapped to ""Other"" per instructions.
    *   `Region`: Includes ""North"", ""South"", ""East"", ""West"", ""Central"". Note that ""West"" and ""Central"" are intentionally *not* included in `region_weights.csv`.

*   **`survey_responses.txt`**:
    *   **Format:** This is a Tab-Separated Value (TSV) file, disguised with a `.txt` extension. Candidates must recognize or be instructed to handle the tab delimiter.
    *   `CustomerID`: Stored as text/string. Some IDs have leading zeros (""01"", ""02"", etc.), while others do not (""10"", ""11"", etc.). This requires standardization (e.g., converting both to integer or padded string) before merging with `customer_info.csv`.
    *   `CustomerID` Coverage: Includes IDs ""01"" through ""18"", plus non-matching IDs ""21"", ""22"". Crucially, it contains duplicate entries for `CustomerID` ""03"" and ""10"" (Rows 103 & 119, Rows 110 & 120 are identical).
    *   `SurveyDate`: Contains various formats (""YYYY-MM-DD"", ""MM/DD/YY"", ""DD/MM/YY"", ""Mon/DD/YYYY"", ""DD-Mon-YYYY"" - some libraries might parse these differently, but the target is ""YYYY-MM-DD""). Includes an empty string (ID 9), ""Invalid Date"" (ID 13), and potentially ambiguous formats like ""01/20/24"" or ""03/10/24"" (could be M/D or D/M depending on locale/parser, but US M/D is common default) and ""20/04/2024"" (clearly D/M/Y). ""Feb/15/2024"" should parse. The goal is to test robust date conversion and handling of failures (empty string and ""Invalid Date"" should fail).
    *   `Score`: Contains two missing values (ID 4, 14).

*   **`region_weights.csv`**:
    *   Provides weights for ""North"", ""South"", ""East"".
    *   Intentionally omits ""West"" and ""Central"" to test the candidate's ability to apply the default weight of 1.0 for missing regions during the merge/lookup in Task 4.

**3. Expected Data Flow and Key Checkpoints:**

*   **Task 1 (Load/Combine):**
    *   Pitfall: Failing to standardize `CustomerID` before merging (e.g., treating integer 1 differently from string ""01"").
    *   Expected Outcome: An inner join after standardizing CustomerID (e.g., to integer) should yield 20 rows (IDs 1-18, with duplicates for 3 and 10). The number of columns should be 7 (CustomerID, Age, Gender, Region, ResponseID, SurveyDate, Score).
*   **Task 2 (Identify Issues):** Based on the 20 merged rows:
    *   Missing Age: 2 (from original file for IDs 5, 15).
    *   Missing Score: 2 (from original file for IDs 4, 14).
    *   Unique Gender: ["""", ""F"", ""M"", ""Male"", ""N/A"", ""Other"", ""female""] (sorted alphabetically).
    *   High Age (>100): 2 (IDs 8, 18).
    *   Duplicate Rows: 2 (the rows for ID 3 and ID 10 are duplicated).
*   **Task 3 (Clean/Adjust):**
    *   Remove Duplicates: 2 rows removed. Dataset now has 18 unique rows (IDs 1-18).
    *   Handle Missing Age: Calculate median Age on the 16 non-missing values *after* duplicate removal but *before* capping. Impute the 2 missing Age values (IDs 5, 15) with this median.
    *   Handle Missing Score: Impute the 2 missing Score values (IDs 4, 14) with 0.
    *   Standardize Gender: ""M""/""Male"" -> ""Male""; ""F""/""female"" -> ""Female""; """"/""N/A""/""Other"" -> ""Other"".
    *   Adjust High Age: Cap Age for IDs 8 and 18 at 100.
    *   Format Date: Convert dates to ""YYYY-MM-DD"". Expect failures for ID 9 (empty) and ID 13 (""Invalid Date""). Count = 2 failures. Other dates should convert successfully if common formats are handled.
    *   Expected Outcome: Final dataset has 18 rows. Calculate median Age and mean Score on this cleaned data. Report row count (18) and date failure count (2).
*   **Task 4 (Apply Weights):**
    *   Merge weights onto the 18 cleaned rows. Regions ""North"", ""South"", ""East"" get weights 1.1, 0.9, 1.05 respectively. Regions ""West"", ""Central"" get the default weight 1.0.
    *   Calculate `WeightedScore = Score * Weight` for all 18 rows.
    *   Expected Outcome: Calculate the mean of the `WeightedScore` column.

**4. Tricky Elements and Common Pitfalls:**

*   **CustomerID Standardization:** The most critical step for Task 1. Failure here cascades errors.
*   **TSV Loading:** Candidate must specify the correct delimiter for `survey_responses.txt`.
*   **Order of Operations (Task 3):** Removing duplicates *before* calculating the median for imputation is crucial. Calculating median *before* capping outliers is also specified.
*   **Date Parsing:** Different tools/libraries might have varying levels of robustness in parsing dates. The key is identifying the unparseable ones ("""" and ""Invalid Date"") and reporting the failure count correctly. Ambiguous formats might cause slight variations if not handled carefully, but the focus is on the specified failures.
*   **Gender Standardization:** Correctly mapping *all* variations including blank and ""N/A"" to the specified categories (""Male"", ""Female"", ""Other"").
*   **Default Weight:** Remembering to apply the default weight of 1.0 when a region is not found in `region_weights.csv`.

By checking the candidate's submitted JSON against the expected values derived from this controlled dataset, the evaluator can accurately assess their basic data preparation skills.

### 2. Explanation of Correct Answers

This section details how each value in the `expected_submission.json` is derived.

**Task 1: Load and Combine Data**

1.  **Load `customer_info.csv`**: Contains 20 rows, `CustomerID` 1-20 (integer).
2.  **Load `survey_responses.txt`**: Tab-separated. Contains 22 rows. `CustomerID` is text, includes ""01""-""18"" and ""21"", ""22"". Rows for ID ""03"" and ""10"" are duplicated.
3.  **Standardize `CustomerID`**: Convert `CustomerID` in both tables to a consistent type (e.g., integer) before merging. `survey_responses.CustomerID` becomes integers 1-18, 21, 22.
4.  **Inner Join**: Merge based on integer `CustomerID`. This matches IDs 1 through 18.
5.  **`merged_rows`**: Since `survey_responses` had duplicate entries for IDs 3 and 10, the inner join results in 16 rows for unique IDs (1, 2, 4-9, 11-18) plus 2 rows for ID 3 and 2 rows for ID 10. Total = 16 + 2 + 2 = **20 rows**.
6.  **`merged_columns`**: `customer_info` has 4 columns. `survey_responses` has 4 columns. Merging on `CustomerID` results in: `CustomerID`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Region` (from customer\_info) + `ResponseID`, `SurveyDate`, `Score` (from survey\_responses). Total = **7 columns**.

**Task 2: Identify Data Issues (Based on 20 merged rows)**

1.  **`missing_age_count`**: Check the `Age` column in the 20 merged rows. Original `customer_info` had missing `Age` for IDs 5 and 15. Both are present in the merge. Count = **2**.
2.  **`missing_score_count`**: Check the `Score` column. Original `survey_responses` had missing `Score` for IDs 4 and 14. Both are present. Count = **2**.
3.  **`unique_gender_values`**: Examine the `Gender` column across the 20 rows. The distinct values are ""Male"", ""F"", ""M"", ""female"", """", ""Other"", ""N/A"". Sorted alphabetically: **`["""", ""F"", ""M"", ""Male"", ""N/A"", ""Other"", ""female""]`**.
4.  **`high_age_rows_count`**: Check `Age > 100`. Original `customer_info` had Age 105 (ID 8) and 110 (ID 18). Both are present. Count = **2**.
5.  **`duplicate_rows_count`**: Identify rows where *all* 7 columns are identical. The two rows for `CustomerID`=3 are identical. The two rows for `CustomerID`=10 are identical. This means there are **2** redundant rows that are duplicates of another row.

**Task 3: Clean and Adjust Data**

1.  **Remove Duplicates**: Start with 20 rows, remove the 2 identified duplicate rows. This leaves 18 unique rows (one for each `CustomerID` 1-18).
    *   `final_rows_count`: **18**.
2.  **Handle Missing Age**:
    *   Calculate median `Age` on the 18 unique rows *before* capping outliers, using only non-missing values. There are 16 non-missing ages (all except IDs 5 and 15): [35, 42, 28, 55, 68, 22, 105, 47, 31, 59, 40, 72, 29, 61, 38, 110].
    *   Sorted: [22, 28, 29, 31, 35, 38, 40, 42, 47, 55, 59, 61, 68, 72, 105, 110].
    *   Median = (42 + 47) / 2 = 44.5.
    *   Impute the 2 missing `Age` values (for IDs 5 and 15) with 44.5.
3.  **Handle Missing Score**: Impute the 2 missing `Score` values (for IDs 4 and 14) with 0.
4.  **Standardize Gender**: Apply rules: ""M"", ""Male"" -> ""Male""; ""F"", ""female"" -> ""Female""; """", ""N/A"", ""Other"" -> ""Other"".
5.  **Adjust High Age**: Cap `Age` at 100 for IDs 8 (was 105) and 18 (was 110).
6.  **Format Survey Date**: Convert `SurveyDate` to ""YYYY-MM-DD"".
    *   Dates for ID 9 (empty string) and ID 13 (""Invalid Date"") cannot be parsed and should result in null/NA.
    *   `date_conversion_failures`: **2**.
7.  **Calculate Final Metrics (on the 18 cleaned rows)**:
    *   `median_age_cleaned`: Ages after imputation and capping: [35, 42, 28, 55, 44.5, 68, 22, 100, 47, 31, 44.5, 59, 40, 100, 29, 61, 38, 72]. Sorted: [22, 28, 29, 31, 35, 38, 40, 42, 44.5, 44.5, 47, 55, 59, 61, 68, 72, 100, 100]. Median = (44.5 + 44.5) / 2 = 44.5. Rounded to 1 decimal place: **44.5**.
    *   `mean_score_cleaned`: Scores after imputation: [85, 77, 92, 0, 68, 75, 88, 95, 82, 60, 79, 81, 90, 0, 70, 65, 83, 99]. Sum = 1289. Mean = 1289 / 18 = 71.6111... Rounded to 2 decimal places: **71.61**.

**Task 4: Apply Weights**

1.  **Load `region_weights.csv`**: North=1.1, South=0.9, East=1.05.
2.  **Merge Weights**: Join weights to the 18 cleaned rows based on `Region`.
3.  **Apply Default Weight**: Regions ""West"" (IDs 5, 10, 15) and ""Central"" (IDs 8, 13, 18) are not in the weights file; use default weight 1.0.
4.  **Calculate `WeightedScore`**: `Score * Weight` for each row:
    *   North (IDs 1, 4, 9, 14): Score * 1.1 (e.g., ID 1: 85*1.1=93.5; ID 4: 0*1.1=0)
    *   South (IDs 2, 6, 11, 16): Score * 0.9 (e.g., ID 2: 77*0.9=69.3)
    *   East (IDs 3, 7, 12, 17): Score * 1.05 (e.g., ID 3: 92*1.05=96.6)
    *   West (IDs 5, 10, 15): Score * 1.0 (e.g., ID 5: 68*1.0=68.0)
    *   Central (IDs 8, 13, 18): Score * 1.0 (e.g., ID 8: 95*1.0=95.0)
5.  **Calculate `mean_weighted_score`**:
    *   Sum of WeightedScores: 93.5 (ID1) + 69.3 (ID2) + 96.6 (ID3) + 0 (ID4) + 68.0 (ID5) + 67.5 (ID6) + 92.4 (ID7) + 95.0 (ID8) + 90.2 (ID9) + 60.0 (ID10) + 71.1 (ID11) + 85.05 (ID12) + 90.0 (ID13) + 0 (ID14) + 70.0 (ID15) + 58.5 (ID16) + 87.15 (ID17) + 99.0 (ID18) = 1393.3
    *   Mean = 1393.3 / 18 = 77.40555...
    *   Rounded to 2 decimal places: **77.41**.

### 3. Passing Criteria

*   **Evaluation Method:** The candidate's submitted `test_submission.json` file will be compared against the `expected_submission.json` key. Each specific numerical value or list within the `results` object will be checked for correctness (including data type and rounding).
*   **Total Checkpoints:** There are 12 specific values to check within the `results` object:
    *   Task 1: 2 values (`merged_rows`, `merged_columns`)
    *   Task 2: 5 values (`missing_age_count`, `missing_score_count`, `unique_gender_values`, `high_age_rows_count`, `duplicate_rows_count`)
    *   Task 3: 4 values (`final_rows_count`, `median_age_cleaned`, `mean_score_cleaned`, `date_conversion_failures`)
    *   Task 4: 1 value (`mean_weighted_score`)
*   **Passing Score:** A candidate is considered to have passed the Basic Data Preparation exam if they achieve **at least 9 out of the 12** correct values.
*   **Rationale:** This threshold (75%) indicates proficiency in the majority of basic data preparation tasks. It allows for minor errors (e.g., a rounding mistake, misinterpretation of one instruction, slight difference in date parsing logic if not affecting failure count) while ensuring the candidate can successfully perform the core steps of loading, identifying issues, cleaning, and adjusting data according to specifications. Getting Task 1 correct is fundamental, as errors here cascade significantly. Errors in later tasks, while penalized, are less critical than failing the initial data setup.","Okay, here is the Python script `task_evaluation.py` that performs the evaluation as requested.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Save the script:** Save the code above as `task_evaluation.py`.
2.  **Prepare JSON files:**
    *   Make sure you have the candidate's submission file (e.g., `test_submission.json`).
    *   Make sure you have the correct answer key file (e.g., `answer_key.json`). You can create this file using the `expected_submission.json` content provided in the `<evaluation_information>` section.
3.  **Run from command line:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the script and JSON files, and run the script like this:

    ```bash
    python task_evaluation.py test_submission.json answer_key.json
    ```

    Replace `test_submission.json` and `answer_key.json` with the actual filenames if they are different.

4.  **Check the output:** The script will print the overall score to the console and create a file named `test_results.json` in the same directory. This file will contain the detailed comparison for each check item and the final percentage score.

Design a remote, **practical** exam to verify whether a Actuaries can Negotiate terms and conditions of reinsurance with other companies..
    This exam will have two parts (basic and advanced). Your current task is **only** to design the basic exam.

    ### Context
    - The candidate has access to a computer with the following tools: Spreadsheets, Text editor and PDF viewer
    - The candidate can also be given digital materials such as Text or Data that must be used for the test.
    - Design a **practical** exam that can be completed remotely using only these tools. A practical exam is an exam actually testing whether the described task can be performed successfully. An exam testing knowledge about the task is NOT a practical exam.
    - To simplify evaluation, the candidate should submit answers in a structured JSON format. Name the file ""test_submission.json"".
    - The candidate should be able to complete the exam in maximum 90 minutes.
    ","Okay, here is the design for the **Basic Level** practical exam for assessing an Actuary's ability to negotiate reinsurance terms and conditions.

**Examiner Explanation:**

*   **Purpose:** This basic exam assesses the candidate's practical ability to receive, analyze, and respond to an initial reinsurance quote. It focuses on identifying key terms, evaluating them against provided context (portfolio data, internal guidelines), identifying points for negotiation, proposing specific changes, and justifying those proposals in a structured manner, simulating the initial steps of a reinsurance negotiation. It tests application, not just theoretical knowledge.
*   **Structure:** The candidate is placed in the role of an actuary at a ceding company (""CedantCo""). They receive a package containing:
    1.  A brief scenario outlining CedantCo's needs and basic internal guidelines (`Scenario.pdf`).
    2.  Simplified portfolio data relevant to the reinsurance need (`Portfolio_Data.csv`).
    3.  An initial reinsurance quote from a potential reinsurer (""ReinsurePro"") (`Reinsurer_Quote.pdf`).
    The candidate must use the provided tools (Spreadsheet for data analysis, Text Editor/PDF Viewer for reading materials and drafting notes) to analyze the quote in light of the data and guidelines. They must then identify specific terms they wish to negotiate, propose concrete changes or requests, and provide brief justifications based on the provided materials. The final output must be submitted in the specified JSON format (`test_submission.json`).
*   **Evaluation Focus:** Evaluation will center on the candidate's ability to:
    *   Correctly interpret the scenario and quote terms.
    *   Perform basic analysis using the provided data (e.g., calculate simple metrics like loss ratios if needed, assess exposure).
    *   Logically connect the analysis and internal guidelines to the quote terms.
    *   Identify reasonable points for negotiation (both potentially unfavorable terms and potentially acceptable ones).
    *   Formulate clear, specific proposed changes or requests.
    *   Provide concise, relevant justifications referencing the provided materials.
    *   Structure the output correctly in the requested JSON format.
*   **Practicality:** The exam simulates a real-world task: reviewing an initial offer and preparing the first round of feedback/counter-proposals. It requires using standard tools for analysis and communication preparation. The JSON output ensures a structured response suitable for remote evaluation.
*   **Time:** The scope (simplified data, clear quote, focused tasks) is designed to be achievable within the 90-minute time limit for a candidate with basic actuarial understanding.

**Exam Instructions: Basic Reinsurance Negotiation Analysis**

**Objective:**

Your task is to act as an Actuary for ""CedantCo"". You will receive an initial reinsurance quote and supporting documents. Your goal is to analyze this quote, identify key terms, assess them against CedantCo's needs and guidelines, calculate a required metric, and propose specific, justified actions for negotiation points.

**Time Limit:** 90 minutes

**Materials Provided:**

You will be provided with the following digital files:

1.  `Scenario.pdf`: Describes CedantCo, its reinsurance objectives for its Homeowners portfolio, and relevant internal guidelines.
2.  `Portfolio_Data.csv`: Contains simplified historical premium and loss data for CedantCo's Homeowners portfolio.
3.  `Reinsurer_Quote.pdf`: An initial Quota Share reinsurance quote from ""ReinsurePro"".
4.  `Instructions.pdf`: This document.

**Tools Allowed:**

*   Spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc)
*   Text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code, TextEdit)
*   PDF viewer

**Tasks:**

1.  **Review Materials:** Carefully read the `Scenario.pdf`, `Reinsurer_Quote.pdf`, and analyze the data in `Portfolio_Data.csv`.
2.  **Calculate Metric:** Using your spreadsheet tool and the data in `Portfolio_Data.csv`, calculate the **5-Year Average Gross Loss Ratio** (Gross Incurred Losses / Gross Earned Premium). Round the result to one decimal place when expressed as a percentage (e.g., 62.3).
3.  **Analyze Quote Terms:** Identify key terms within the `Reinsurer_Quote.pdf`. For each significant term (including, but not limited to, Ceding Commission, Exclusions, and Clauses mentioned):
    *   Assess the term based on the provided scenario, data, and guidelines. Choose the most appropriate assessment from the predefined list below.
    *   Decide on a proposed action regarding the term. Choose the most appropriate action from the predefined list below.
    *   If action is required (not ""Accept""), determine a specific proposed value or request. This might be a number (e.g., ""28.0%""), a specific change (e.g., ""Remove Exclusion""), or a request for clarification (e.g., ""Clarify Adjustment Mechanism""). Use ""N/A"" if your proposed action is ""Accept"".
    *   Identify the primary piece of evidence from the provided materials (`Scenario.pdf` or `Portfolio_Data.csv`) that supports your assessment and proposed action. You will need to reference this evidence specifically (e.g., ""Scenario.pdf - Internal Guidelines - Target Ceding Commission"", ""Portfolio_Data.csv - Calculated 5yr Avg Loss Ratio"", ""Scenario.pdf - Objective - Reduce Volatility"").
4.  **Format Output:** Structure your calculated metric and your analysis of the negotiation points into a single JSON file named `test_submission.json`. Use the exact format specified below. Ensure the JSON is valid.

**Predefined Lists for JSON Fields:**

*   **`assessment`**: Choose one from:
    *   `""Acceptable""`

    **CedantCo - Reinsurance Need Overview**

    **1. Company Profile:**
    CedantCo is a regional property and casualty insurer operating primarily in coastal states in the Southeast USA. Our primary focus is on personal lines.

    **2. Portfolio for Reinsurance:**
    We are seeking reinsurance for our **Homeowners (HO)** line of business. Key characteristics of this portfolio are outlined in the provided `Portfolio_Data.csv`. The portfolio has experienced moderate growth and some variability in loss experience due to weather-related events, although no single catastrophic hurricane has directly impacted the core portfolio significantly in the last 5 years.

    **3. Reinsurance Objective:**
    The primary objectives for this reinsurance placement are:
    *   **Reduce Volatility:** Smooth underwriting results impacted by attritional and weather-related losses.
    *   **Protect Surplus:** Limit the impact of large losses or accumulations of losses on the company's surplus.
    *   **Target Structure:** A **50% Quota Share** treaty is the desired structure.

    **4. Internal Guidelines & Considerations:**
    *   **Target Ceding Commission:** Must achieve a minimum **fixed** ceding commission of **27.5%** to adequately cover acquisition costs, premium taxes, and internal administrative expenses allocated to this line. Provisional or sliding scale commissions are generally less preferred unless significantly advantageous.
    *   **Coverage Scope:** Coverage should be comprehensive for the risks underwritten in the HO portfolio. Significant exclusions, particularly for perils inherent to the covered region (e.g., weather), are undesirable.
    *   **Claims Handling:** Maintain control over standard claims handling. Reinsurer involvement should be limited to significant claims. A claims control threshold below $250,000 may require discussion due to administrative burden.
    *   **Broker:** This placement is being handled directly; no brokerage is involved.

</MATERIALS_FOR_CANDIDATE>

<MATERIALS_EXPLANATION_FOR_EVALUATOR>
    **1. Material Creation & Relationships:**
    *   **`Scenario.pdf`:** Sets the scene and provides clear, quantifiable guidelines.
        *   **Target Ceding Commission (27.5% fixed):** This is intentionally set higher than the quote's offer (26.0% fixed) to create a clear negotiation point. The preference for ""fixed"" is also stated.
        *   **Objective (Reduce Volatility):** This links directly to the problematic ""Named Storm Exclusion"" in the quote, as excluding major weather events undermines this goal for a coastal HO portfolio.
        *   **Claims Control Threshold ($250,000):** The guideline suggests a threshold below $250k might be burdensome. The quote offers $150k, creating another negotiation point based on internal administrative preference.
        *   **Portfolio (HO, Coastal States):** Reinforces the relevance of the Named Storm exclusion.
        *   **Broker (None):** Simplifies the scenario, removing brokerage as a factor.
    *   **`Portfolio_Data.csv`:** Provides data for a required calculation and context.
        *   **Data:** Simple structure (Year, GWP, GEP, Losses, Policies). GEP and Losses are needed for the loss ratio calculation.
        *   **Calculation:** The 5-Year Average Gross Loss Ratio is calculated as:
            *   Total Gross Incurred Losses (2019-2023) = 35.1 + 38.19 + 42.0 + 39.69 + 44.22 = 199.2 Million USD
            *   Total Gross Earned Premium (2019-2023) = 54.0 + 57.0 + 60.0 + 63.0 + 66.0 = 300.0 Million USD
            *   Average Loss Ratio = 199.2 / 300.0 = 0.664 = **66.4%**
        *   **Loss Ratio Context:** A 66.4% loss ratio is moderately high. While the reinsurer's 26% ceding commission offer might seem justifiable given this LR, the candidate *must* refer to the explicit 27.5% minimum guideline in the scenario. The calculation itself is a required task.
        *   **Loss Notes:** The note about ""no single loss event exceeding $1,500,000"" provides context for the Claims Control Clause threshold. A $150k threshold seems low relative to the largest single losses but potentially high relative to average claim sizes (not provided, but implied). The key is the comparison to the $250k guideline in the scenario.
    *   **`Reinsurer_Quote.pdf`:** Contains the terms to be analyzed.
        *   **Ceding Commission (26.0% Fixed):** Directly contradicts the `Scenario.pdf` guideline (27.5% minimum). Expected Action: Request Change to 27.5%. Assessment: Below Guideline. Evidence: `Scenario.pdf - Internal Guidelines - Target Ceding Commission`.
        *   **Named Storm Exclusion:** Conflicts with the portfolio type (HO, Coastal) and the objective (`Reduce Volatility`). Expected Action: Request Removal. Assessment: Potentially Problematic. Evidence: `Scenario.pdf - Objective - Reduce Volatility` or `Scenario.pdf - Company Profile/Portfolio`.
        *   **Claims Control Clause ($150,000):** Below the preferred minimum threshold mentioned in the `Scenario.pdf` guidelines ($250k). Expected Action: Request Change to $250,000. Assessment: Below Guideline (or potentially ""Potentially Problematic"" due to admin burden). Evidence: `Scenario.pdf - Internal Guidelines - Claims Handling`.
        *   **Other Terms (50% QS, Business Covered, Standard Exclusions like War/Nuclear):** These are generally aligned with the scenario or standard market practice and should likely be assessed as ""Acceptable"".

    **2. Cross-References & Connections:**
    *   The Ceding Commission guideline (Scenario) vs. the Quote.
    *   The Reinsurance Objective/Portfolio type (Scenario) vs. the Named Storm Exclusion (Quote).
    *   The Claims Handling guideline (Scenario) vs. the Claims Control Clause threshold (Quote).
    *   The Portfolio Data (CSV) is needed to calculate the Loss Ratio (required metric) and provides context for loss history relevant to the Claims Control Clause.

    **3. Tricky Elements & Common Pitfalls:**
    *   **Loss Ratio vs. Guideline:** Candidates might try to justify accepting the lower ceding commission based on the calculated 66.4% loss ratio. However, the instructions and scenario emphasize following the *internal guideline* (27.5% minimum). The primary justification should be the guideline, not the LR itself (though the LR is context).
    *   **Fixed vs. Provisional:** The scenario prefers fixed commission, and the quote offers fixed, but at the wrong level. Candidates should note the level is the issue.
    *   **Claims Control Justification:** Candidates might incorrectly link the $150k threshold only to the largest loss note ($1.5M) in the CSV, deeming it acceptable. The key is the explicit guideline in the `Scenario.pdf` about administrative burden below $250k.
    *   **Specificity of Evidence:** Candidates must provide the specific reference string as requested (e.g., ""Scenario.pdf - Internal Guidelines - Target Ceding Commission""), not just a general statement.
    *   **JSON Format:** Errors in JSON syntax or using non-predefined values for `assessment` or `proposed_action` will lead to deductions. Forgetting the `calculated_metrics` section or miscalculating the LR.
    *   **Completeness:** Failing to analyze all key terms presented (Ceding Commission, Named Storm Exclusion, Claims Control Clause).

    **4. ""Hidden"" Information:**
    *   The preference for a **fixed** commission in the scenario guidelines is important context for evaluating the quoted commission.
    *   The implication of ""Coastal States"" in the Scenario reinforces why the Named Storm exclusion is problematic, even if major hurricanes weren't explicitly listed in the CSV notes (which mention ""weather-related events"").
    *   The guideline about administrative burden related to the claims threshold is crucial and distinct from just looking at maximum loss size.

    **CedantCo - Reinsurance Need Overview**

    **1. Company Profile:**
    CedantCo is a regional property and casualty insurer operating primarily in coastal states in the Southeast USA. Our primary focus is on personal lines.

    **2. Portfolio for Reinsurance:**
    We are seeking reinsurance for our **Homeowners (HO)** line of business. Key characteristics of this portfolio are outlined in the provided `Portfolio_Data.csv`. The portfolio has experienced moderate growth and some variability in loss experience due to weather-related events, although no single catastrophic hurricane has directly impacted the core portfolio significantly in the last 5 years.

    **3. Reinsurance Objective:**
    The primary objectives for this reinsurance placement are:
    *   **Reduce Volatility:** Smooth underwriting results impacted by attritional and weather-related losses.
    *   **Protect Surplus:** Limit the impact of large losses or accumulations of losses on the company's surplus.
    *   **Target Structure:** A **50% Quota Share** treaty is the desired structure.

    **4. Internal Guidelines & Considerations:**
    *   **Target Ceding Commission:** Must achieve a minimum **fixed** ceding commission of **27.5%** to adequately cover acquisition costs, premium taxes, and internal administrative expenses allocated to this line. Provisional or sliding scale commissions are generally less preferred unless significantly advantageous.
    *   **Coverage Scope:** Coverage should be comprehensive for the risks underwritten in the HO portfolio. Significant exclusions, particularly for perils inherent to the covered region (e.g., weather), are undesirable.
    *   **Claims Handling:** Maintain control over standard claims handling. Reinsurer involvement should be limited to significant claims. A claims control threshold below $250,000 may require discussion due to administrative burden.
    *   **Broker:** This placement is being handled directly; no brokerage is involved.

**2. Explanation of Correct Answers**

*   **`calculated_metrics`**:
    *   **Metric:** 5-Year Average Gross Loss Ratio (%)
    *   **Calculation:**
        *   Total Gross Incurred Losses (2019-2023) = 35,100,000 + 38,190,000 + 42,000,000 + 39,690,000 + 44,220,000 = 199,200,000 USD
        *   Total Gross Earned Premium (2019-2023) = 54,000,000 + 57,000,000 + 60,000,000 + 63,000,000 + 66,000,000 = 300,000,000 USD
        *   Average Loss Ratio = 199,200,000 / 300,000,000 = 0.664
        *   Value (as percentage, rounded to one decimal): **66.4**
    *   **Rationale:** This requires correct summation from the `Portfolio_Data.csv` and the correct calculation (Losses / Earned Premium), followed by correct formatting.

*   **`negotiation_points`**:

    1.  **Term: Ceding Commission**
        *   **Quoted:** ""26.0% Fixed""
        *   **Analysis:** The `Scenario.pdf` explicitly states a ""minimum fixed ceding commission of 27.5%"" is required under Internal Guidelines. The quoted 26.0% is below this mandatory minimum.
        *   **Assessment:** `""Below Guideline""` is the correct choice.
        *   **Action:** `""Request Change""` is necessary as the term is unacceptable as quoted.
        *   **Proposal:** `""Request increase to 27.5% Fixed""` (or similar wording asking for the minimum guideline) is the logical request. Mentioning ""Fixed"" aligns with the guideline's preference.
        *   **Evidence:** `""Scenario.pdf - Internal Guidelines - Target Ceding Commission""` directly supports this point. *Common Error:* Justifying acceptance based on the calculated 66.4% LR; the guideline takes precedence.

    2.  **Term: Named Storm Exclusion**
        *   **Quoted:** ""Included""
        *   **Analysis:** The `Scenario.pdf` states the company operates in ""coastal states"" and a primary objective is to ""Reduce Volatility"". Excluding Named Storms (a major source of volatility for coastal HO business) directly contradicts this objective.
        *   **Assessment:** `""Potentially Problematic""` is the most fitting assessment as it significantly impacts the coverage suitability.
        *   **Action:** `""Request Removal""` is the most direct action to align the coverage with the objective.
        *   **Proposal:** `""Remove Exclusion""` clearly states the desired outcome. (Alternative acceptable proposal: ""Query scope / Request modification with sublimit"", but removal is stronger given the objective).
        *   **Evidence:** `""Scenario.pdf - Objective - Reduce Volatility""` is the strongest link. `""Scenario.pdf - Company Profile/Portfolio""` (mentioning coastal states) is also relevant context.

    3.  **Term: Claims Control Clause**
        *   **Quoted:** ""USD 150,000""
        *   **Analysis:** The `Scenario.pdf` notes under Internal Guidelines (Claims Handling) that a threshold ""below $250,000 may require discussion due to administrative burden,"" implying a preference for $250,000 or higher. The quoted $150,000 falls into this category.
        *   **Assessment:** `""Below Guideline""` reflects that the quoted value is lower than the preferred operational threshold mentioned in the guidelines. `""Potentially Problematic""` could be acceptable if justified by admin burden.
        *   **Action:** `""Request Change""` is needed to align with operational preference.
        *   **Proposal:** `""Request increase to USD 250,000""` directly addresses the guideline.
        *   **Evidence:** `""Scenario.pdf - Internal Guidelines - Claims Handling""` is the specific reference. *Common Error:* Judging the $150k only against the max single loss ($1.5M) in the data notes, ignoring the specific administrative guideline.

    4.  **Term: Cession Percentage**
        *   **Quoted:** ""50% Quota Share""
        *   **Analysis:** The `Scenario.pdf` states the ""Target Structure"" is a ""50% Quota Share"". The quote matches this exactly.
        *   **Assessment:** `""Acceptable""`
        *   **Action:** `""Accept""`
        *   **Proposal:** `""N/A""`
        *   **Evidence:** `""Scenario.pdf - Target Structure""`

**3. Passing Criteria**

This is a basic exam focused on core analysis and identification of key negotiation points based on provided guidelines.

*   **Total Possible Points:** 100
*   **Passing Score:** 70

**Scoring Breakdown:**

1.  **JSON Validity & Structure (10 points):**
    *   File named correctly (`test_submission.json`): 2 points
    *   Valid JSON format (parsable): 4 points
    *   Correct overall structure (top-level keys, array/object types): 4 points
    *   *Note:* If JSON is invalid, automated scoring may fail. Significant structural errors may warrant a failing grade regardless of content accuracy.

2.  **Calculated Metric (10 points):**
    *   Correct `metric_name`: 2 points
    *   Correct `value` (66.4): 8 points (Allow minor rounding difference, e.g., 66.4 +/- 0.1, for full points if calculation logic seems correct but rounding differs slightly).

3.  **Negotiation Points (80 points total - distributed across key terms):**

    *   **Ceding Commission Analysis (20 points):**
        *   Correct `term_quoted` & `quoted_value`: 2 points
        *   Correct `assessment` (""Below Guideline""): 4 points
        *   Correct `proposed_action` (""Request Change""): 4 points
        *   Correct/Logical `proposed_value_or_request` (e.g., ""Request increase to 27.5% Fixed""): 5 points
        *   Correct `supporting_evidence_reference`: 5 points

    *   **Named Storm Exclusion Analysis (20 points):**
        *   Correct `term_quoted` & `quoted_value`: 2 points
        *   Correct `assessment` (""Potentially Problematic""): 4 points
        *   Correct `proposed_action` (""Request Removal""): 4 points
        *   Correct/Logical `proposed_value_or_request` (e.g., ""Remove Exclusion""): 5 points
        *   Correct `supporting_evidence_reference`: 5 points

    *   **Claims Control Clause Analysis (20 points):**
        *   Correct `term_quoted` & `quoted_value`: 2 points
        *   Correct `assessment` (""Below Guideline""): 4 points
        *   Correct `proposed_action` (""Request Change""): 4 points
        *   Correct/Logical `proposed_value_or_request` (e.g., ""Request increase to USD 250,000""): 5 points
        *   Correct `supporting_evidence_reference`: 5 points

    *   **Identification of Acceptable Key Terms (e.g., Cession %, Business Covered) (10 points total):**
        *   Correctly identifying *at least one* key term as acceptable (e.g., Cession Percentage or Business Covered) with correct `assessment`, `action`, `proposal` (""N/A""), and `evidence`: 5 points
        *   Correctly identifying *both* Cession Percentage and Business Covered as acceptable with correct details: 10 points (No penalty for missing these if the main 3 are correct, but rewards thoroughness).

    *   **Use of Predefined Values & Specificity (10 points):**
        *   Strict adherence to predefined strings for `assessment` and `proposed_action` across all analyzed points: 5 points
        *   Clear and specific references used for `supporting_evidence_reference` (not vague): 5 points

**Passing Threshold Rationale:**

A score of 70 requires the candidate to:
*   Get the calculation correct (or very close).
*   Correctly identify and propose appropriate actions/values for *at least two* of the three major negotiation points (Commission, Exclusion, Claims Control), including correct justification.
*   Correctly handle *at least one* of the acceptable terms OR demonstrate high accuracy on the major points.
*   Submit a valid, well-structured JSON file adhering mostly to format requirements.

This ensures the candidate can perform the core tasks: calculate a key metric, read guidelines, compare them to a quote, identify major discrepancies, propose reasonable changes with justification, and structure the output correctly. Missing one major point but excelling elsewhere, or getting all major points mostly right with minor errors, could still allow a pass. Failing on two or more major points or making significant calculation/formatting errors would likely result in a fail.","```python

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import Libraries:** Imports `json`, `argparse` (for command-line arguments), `sys` (for error output and exit), `os` (to check file existence), and `math` (for `isclose` float comparison).
2.  **Configuration:** Defines `TOTAL_POSSIBLE_POINTS` and the `POINTS` dictionary, mirroring the scoring rubric provided in the `<evaluation_information>`. It also includes `PREDEFINED_ASSESSMENTS` and `PREDEFINED_ACTIONS` lists for validation.
3.  **`load_json(file_path)`:** Safely loads a JSON file, handling `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`. Returns `None` on decode error to allow partial scoring.
4.  **`check_structure(data)`:** Validates the presence and basic types of required keys and nested structures in the candidate's submission. Returns `(True, message)` or `(False, error_message)`.
5.  **`compare_values(candidate_val, key_val, tolerance)`:** Compares candidate and key values. Uses `math.isclose` for floats with tolerance, and strict string comparison otherwise.
6.  **`score_structure_validity(candidate_data)`:** Scores JSON validity (implicitly by checking if `candidate_data` is not `None`) and structure using `check_structure`.
7.  **`score_calculated_metric(candidate_metrics, key_metrics)`:** Finds the metric by name, checks the name itself, and compares the value using `compare_values` with tolerance.
8.  **`score_negotiation_points(candidate_points, key_points)`:**
    *   Uses dictionaries keyed by `term_quoted` for efficient lookup.
    *   Iterates through the *key's* points to ensure all required terms are evaluated.
    *   Determines the scoring category (`term_commission`, `term_exclusion`, etc.) for each term.
    *   Compares each field (`quoted_value`, `assessment`, etc.) using `compare_values`.
    *   Handles the special case where `proposed_value_or_request` should be ""N/A"" if the action is ""Accept"".
    *   Tracks adherence to predefined lists (`assessment`, `action`) and evidence specificity *during* the iteration.
    *   Specifically scores the required ""Acceptable Terms"" based on whether they were fully correct.
    *   Returns the total score for this section, detailed breakdown, and the adherence check results.
9.  **`score_adherence(adherence_details)`:** Takes the adherence flags collected during negotiation point scoring and assigns points based on the rubric.
10. **`main()`:**
    *   Sets up `argparse` to get submission and key file paths.
    *   Loads the JSON data using `load_json`.
    *   Initializes the `results` dictionary.
    *   Calls the scoring functions for each section, accumulating the `total_score`.
    *   Handles potential errors gracefully (e.g., if JSON is invalid, scoring might be partial).
    *   Calculates the final `overall_score` as a percentage.
    *   Saves the detailed `results` dictionary to `test_results.json` using `json.dump` with indentation.
    *   Prints the final score and output file location to the console.

**To Run the Script:**

1.  Save the code above as `task_evaluation.py`.
2.  Make sure you have the candidate's submission file (e.g., `test_submission.json`) and the answer key file (you'll need to create this from the `<evaluation_information>`, let's call it `answer_key.json`) in the same directory.
3.  Run from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python task_evaluation.py test_submission.json answer_key.json
    ```
4.  The script will print the overall score and create the `test_results.json` file with the detailed breakdown.",,"[""Error saving assets for 20951.0: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 51 column 5 (char 1878)"", ['Error: File not found at answer_key.json\n'], ""Error saving assets for 20951.0: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 51 column 5 (char 1874)"", [''], ""Error saving assets for 20951.0: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 51 column 5 (char 1874)"", [None, 'no overall score found'], ""Error saving assets for 20951.0: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 51 column 5 (char 1878)"", ['Error: File not found at answer_key.json\n']]",True,True,0.0,99.0,,4.0,True,,"{'overview': prompt_token_count: 236

**(Content of the TXT file)**

```text
Requirement ID: RG-01
Description: User must be able to navigate to a new 'My Reading Goals' page from their main user dashboard. A link/button should be clearly visible on the dashboard.

Requirement ID: RG-02
Description: On the 'My Reading Goals' page, if no goal is set for the current year, the user can input a number (positive integer > 0) as their 'Books to Read This Year' goal. This goal must be savable. Only one goal per user per calendar year.

Requirement ID: RG-03
Description: Once a goal is set, the 'My Reading Goals' page must display the goal number and the current progress count (e.g., ""Progress: 5 / 20 books read""). The initial progress count is 0.

Requirement ID: RG-04
Description: When a user marks a book as 'read' using the existing functionality on the platform (e.g., on a book's detail page or their bookshelf), the progress count on the 'My Reading Goals' page must be incremented by one.

Requirement ID: RG-05
Description: The progress display ('X / Y books read') on the 'My Reading Goals' page should update automatically or upon page refresh after a book is marked as read.

Requirement ID: RG-06
Description: The user must be able to edit/change their saved goal number for the current year at any time before the year ends. Saving the new goal should update the display.

```text
Technical Notes - Reading Goals Feature

- Platform: This feature is for the web application ONLY. No mobile application development or testing is included in this phase.
- Browsers: Must function correctly on the latest stable versions of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Testing on other browsers (e.g., Safari, Edge, IE) is NOT required for this release.
- Authentication: Testing assumes the user is already logged into their SimpleReads account. The login/logout process and user registration are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for this feature's testing.
- Performance: No specific performance or load testing is required for this initial release. Focus is on functional correctness.
- UI/UX: The feature should adhere to existing site styles. Basic usability is expected (e.g., clear labels, intuitive interaction flow), but a major UI redesign or extensive usability testing is OUT OF SCOPE.
- Data: Assumes existing user data and book data structures are stable. No data migration testing is needed.
```

**Important Notes on Format:**

*   Ensure the final file is valid JSON. Use a JSON validator if unsure.
*   Pay close attention to data types (string, integer, array, object).
*   Use the exact key names specified in the structure.
*   Adhere strictly to the ""YYYY-MM-DD"" format for all dates.
*   Use the exact Requirement IDs (e.g., ""RG-01"") as provided in the materials when referencing requirements.
*   Replace `""YOUR_CANDIDATE_ID""` with the specific model ID provided or identified for your session.","You are an excellent examiner of Software Quality Assurance Analysts and Testers capabilities. Design a remote, **practical** exam to verify whether a Software Quality Assurance Analysts and Testers can Plan test schedules or strategies in accordance with project scope or delivery dates..
    This exam will have two parts (basic and advanced). Your current task is **only** to design the basic exam.

    ### Context
    - The candidate has access to a computer with the following tools: Spreadsheets, Text editor and PDF viewer
    - The candidate can also be given digital materials such as Text or Data that must be used for the test.
    - Design a **practical** exam that can be completed remotely using only these tools. A practical exam is an exam actually testing whether the described task can be performed successfully. An exam testing knowledge about the task is NOT a practical exam.
    - To simplify evaluation, the candidate should submit answers in a structured JSON format. Name the file ""test_submission.json"".
    - The candidate should be able to complete the exam in maximum 90 minutes.
    ","Okay, here is the design for the **Basic Level Practical Exam** focusing on planning test schedules/strategies.

**Exam Purpose and Structure (For Evaluator)**

*   **Purpose:** This basic practical exam assesses a candidate's fundamental ability to analyze a simple project scope, understand delivery constraints, and create a realistic, high-level test schedule and strategy outline. It focuses on core planning skills rather than deep strategic thinking or complex risk analysis (which would be covered in the advanced exam).
*   **Structure:**
    1.  **Scenario Presentation:** The candidate receives a set of digital documents describing a small, well-defined project or feature enhancement.
    2.  **Task Execution:** The candidate analyzes the materials and performs specific planning tasks using standard tools (Spreadsheet, Text Editor).
    3.  **Output Generation:** The candidate structures their plan into a predefined JSON format and submits the `test_submission.json` file.
*   **Evaluation Focus:**
    *   Did the candidate correctly identify the scope of testing based on the provided materials?
    *   Is the proposed schedule aligned with the given project milestones/deadlines?
    *   Are the testing activities logically sequenced?
    *   Is there a basic prioritization of test activities/features?
    *   Are fundamental assumptions or risks identified?
    *   Is the output structured correctly in the requested JSON format?
*   **Tools & Time:** Spreadsheet, Text Editor, PDF Viewer. Max 90 minutes.
*   **Nature:** Practical application of planning skills on a defined, simple scenario.

```
</MATERIALS_FOR_CANDIDATE>

<MATERIALS_EXPLANATION_FOR_EVALUATOR>
**1. How Materials Were Created:**
*   The materials were synthetically generated to represent a typical small feature request in a web application context.
*   **`Project_Brief_ReadingGoals.pdf`**: Provides the essential context and, crucially, the fixed timeline constraints (QA Start: 2024-07-30, QA Complete: 2024-08-09). This defines a specific testing window of 9 working days (inclusive, assuming Mon-Fri work week: Jul 30, 31, Aug 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). The simplicity (1 Dev, 1 QA) implies limited resources.
*   **`Feature_Requirements_ReadingGoals.txt`**: Lists distinct, testable functional requirements. Each has a unique ID (RG-01 to RG-06) that the candidate *must* use for identification and prioritization in the JSON output. The requirements cover setup (RG-01, RG-02), core display/update (RG-03, RG-04, RG-05), and modification (RG-06).
*   **`Technical_Notes.txt`**: Explicitly defines boundaries. It clearly states what *is* in scope (Web, Chrome, Firefox) and what is *out of scope* (Mobile, Other Browsers, Authentication, Performance, Major UI/Usability testing, Data Migration). This directly informs the candidate's ""testing_scope"" section in the JSON.

**2. Cross-References and Connections:**
*   The **Requirement IDs** (RG-01 to RG-06) from `Feature_Requirements_ReadingGoals.txt` are the primary link. They must appear in the `testing_scope.in_scope` list and the `prioritized_requirements` list in the candidate's JSON submission.
*   The **Dates** from `Project_Brief_ReadingGoals.pdf` (QA Start: 2024-07-30, QA Complete: 2024-08-09) are absolute constraints for the `test_schedule` section of the JSON. All scheduled activities must fall within this window.
*   The **Out-of-Scope** items mentioned in `Technical_Notes.txt` (Mobile, Auth, Perf, Other Browsers, Major UI) should directly map to the `testing_scope.out_of_scope` list in the JSON.
*   The **Browser** requirements (Chrome, Firefox) from `Technical_Notes.txt` should inform the `test_approach_summary` and potentially appear as a specific activity in the `test_schedule`.
*   The mention of ""Basic usability"" in `Technical_Notes.txt` might lead a candidate to include ""Usability Testing"" in their `test_approach_summary`, which is acceptable, but they should also note that *extensive* usability testing is out of scope.

**3. Tricky Elements and Common Pitfalls:**
*   **Timeline Calculation:** The most common pitfall is miscalculating the available working days (9 days) between 2024-07-30 and 2024-08-09 and creating an unrealistic schedule (either too packed or not allocating time for essential phases like design, execution, regression, reporting).
*   **Scope Definition:** Candidates might incorrectly include items explicitly mentioned as out-of-scope (like Authentication) or fail to list all provided requirements (RG-01 to RG-06) as in-scope. They might also forget to list *any* out-of-scope items.
*   **Prioritization Logic:** While some variation is acceptable, a completely illogical prioritization (e.g., prioritizing editing the goal (RG-06) over setting it (RG-02) or tracking progress (RG-04)) would indicate poor understanding. Core functionality (RG-02, RG-03, RG-04) should generally be prioritized higher.
*   **JSON Format Adherence:** Errors in JSON syntax, incorrect date formats (must be YYYY-MM-DD), missing fields, or using incorrect Requirement IDs will lead to deductions.
*   **Assumptions vs. Risks:** Candidates may confuse assumptions (things believed to be true for the plan to work, e.g., environment readiness) with risks (potential problems that could derail the plan, e.g., late builds).
*   **Over-planning:** Given the basic nature and short timeline, proposing overly complex testing types (e.g., extensive automation, security testing) or a very granular schedule might be unrealistic.

**4. ""Hidden"" Information:**
*   There isn't intentionally hidden information, but careful reading is required to synthesize details from all three documents. For example:
    *   Recognizing the 9-day testing window requires looking at the calendar dates in the Brief.
    *   Understanding that RG-04 relies on ""existing functionality"" implies a need for some light regression testing around that integration point, even if the existing functionality itself isn't being re-tested from scratch.
    *   The 1 QA resource constraint implies the schedule needs to be manageable for a single person.

**2. Explanation of Correct Answers and Derivations**

*   **`exam_type`, `candidate_id`, `project_feature`**: These are metadata fields. `exam_type` and `project_feature` are fixed based on the instructions. `candidate_id` should be replaced by the candidate's identifier.
*   **`testing_scope`**:
    *   **`in_scope`**: Derived directly from `Feature_Requirements_ReadingGoals.txt` (all RG-01 to RG-06 must be listed, ideally with brief descriptions) and `Technical_Notes.txt` (Web only, Chrome/Firefox compatibility, Basic Usability). Candidates *must* reference the RG IDs.
    *   **`out_of_scope`**: Derived directly from explicit statements in `Technical_Notes.txt` (Mobile, Other Browsers, Auth, Perf, Major UI, Data Migration). Adding clarification like ""testing the existing 'mark as read' function itself"" shows deeper understanding.
*   **`test_approach_summary`**:
    *   **`primary_focus`**: Based on the nature of requirements (functional) and technical constraints (browsers). Functional Testing is key. Browser Compatibility is explicitly required. Basic Usability is mentioned. Integration Testing is implied by RG-04 interacting with existing functionality.
    *   **`methodology`**: Given the scenario (small feature, single QA, basic level), ""Manual testing based on requirements"" is the most logical primary approach. Adding ""exploratory testing"" is a good supplement. Automation is unlikely given the scope and timeline for a basic exam.
*   **`prioritized_requirements`**:
    *   All requirements (RG-01 to RG-06) must be listed.
    *   The priority order should be logical. The key provides a reasonable example:
        1.  RG-01 (Access): Can't test anything else without accessing the page.
        2.  RG-02 (Set Goal): Core setup function.
        3.  RG-04 (Increment Progress): Core interaction/update mechanism.
        4.  RG-03 (Display): Essential feedback linked to RG-02/RG-04.
        5.  RG-05 (Update Display): Refinement of RG-03/RG-04 interaction.
        6.  RG-06 (Edit Goal): Important, but less critical than initial setup and tracking.
    *   *Slight variations in priority (e.g., swapping 3 and 4) might be acceptable if the candidate provides justification (though justification isn't required in the JSON for the basic exam).* Grossly illogical ordering (e.g., putting RG-06 first) is incorrect.
*   **`test_schedule`**:
    *   **Dates**: All activities *must* fall strictly between the QA Start Date (2024-07-30) and QA Complete Date (2024-08-09) inclusive, as per `Project_Brief_ReadingGoals.pdf`. Dates must be in YYYY-MM-DD format.
    *   **Activities**: Should cover logical phases: Planning/Design, Execution (ideally split by priority or type), Browser Checks, Regression (important due to RG-04 integration), Buffer/Retesting time, and Reporting.
    *   **Feasibility**: The schedule must be realistic for a single QA resource over the available 9 working days (Jul 30, 31; Aug 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). The key provides a balanced allocation. Overly compressed schedules or schedules missing key activities (like regression or buffer time) are weak points.
*   **`risks_and_assumptions`**:
    *   **`assumptions`**: Should list conditions believed to be true for the plan to work. Common examples relate to environment readiness, build delivery timing, requirement stability, and tool access. Must list at least 2.
    *   **`risks`**: Should list potential events that could negatively impact the plan. Common examples relate to delays, blocking defects, environment issues, and estimation errors. Must list at least 2.
    *   The key provides standard, relevant examples for this type of project. The candidate should identify plausible items based on the scenario.

**3. Passing Criteria (Basic Exam)**

This exam assesses fundamental planning ability. Passing requires demonstrating a basic understanding of scope analysis, scheduling within constraints, and risk awareness, along with the technical ability to follow formatting instructions.

**Minimum Requirements for Passing (Checklist Approach):**

1.  **Valid JSON Submission:** The submitted `test_submission.json` file MUST be valid JSON and adhere to the specified structure (correct keys, data types - arrays, strings, objects, integers). **(Critical Fail if Invalid)**
2.  **Scope Identification (Accuracy > 75%):**
    *   At least 5 out of 6 RG requirements correctly listed in `in_scope`.
    *   Browser compatibility (Chrome/Firefox) correctly listed in `in_scope`.
    *   At least 4 distinct, correct items listed in `out_of_scope` based on `Technical_Notes.txt`.
3.  **Test Approach (Logical):**
    *   `primary_focus` includes at least ""Functional Testing"" and ""Browser Compatibility Testing"".
    *   `methodology` is plausible (e.g., Manual based on requirements).
4.  **Prioritization (Logical):**
    *   All 6 RG requirements are listed in `prioritized_requirements`.
    *   The priority order is generally logical (e.g., RG-01/RG-02/RG-04 are ranked higher than RG-06). Minor deviations are acceptable, but core setup/interaction should precede less critical functions.
5.  **Test Schedule (Feasible & Constrained):**
    *   All `start` and `end` dates are in the correct YYYY-MM-DD format. **(Critical Fail if Format Incorrect)**
    *   All scheduled activities fall strictly within the 2024-07-30 to 2024-08-09 window. **(Critical Fail if Dates Outside Window)**
    *   The schedule includes distinct phases for at least: Test Design/Planning, Functional Execution, Browser Testing, and Regression/Buffer time.
    *   The allocation of time across activities is plausible (not overly compressed or wasteful).
6.  **Risks & Assumptions (Relevant):**
    *   At least 2 relevant assumptions are listed.
    *   At least 2 relevant risks are listed.

**Scoring (Optional - More Granular Evaluation):**

A points system could be used for finer grading:

*   JSON Validity & Structure: 15 points (0 if invalid)
*   Scope (`in_scope` accuracy): 15 points
*   Scope (`out_of_scope` accuracy): 10 points
*   Test Approach (logic & completeness): 10 points
*   Prioritization (all listed & logical order): 15 points
*   Schedule (dates format & within window): 10 points (0 if dates wrong/outside)
*   Schedule (activity coverage & feasibility): 15 points
*   Risks & Assumptions (relevance & count): 10 points
*   **Total: 100 points**

**Passing Score:** Typically 65-70 points.

**Emphasis:** The focus is on *practical application*. Can the candidate take requirements and constraints and produce a *workable*, *basic* plan outline formatted correctly? Minor imperfections in prioritization logic or the exact schedule breakdown are less critical than fundamental errors like incorrect scope, invalid dates, or inability to follow the JSON format.","```python

**Explanation:**

1.  **Configuration:** Defines points for each section, total points, QA window dates, and expected keywords/IDs based on the provided evaluation criteria and answer key.
2.  **Helper Functions:**
    *   `load_json_file`: Safely loads JSON, handling file not found and decode errors.
    *   `check_keys`: Verifies if required keys exist in a dictionary section.
    *   `validate_date_str`: Checks if a string matches ""YYYY-MM-DD"" format and converts it to a date object.
    *   `extract_rg_ids`: Pulls out ""RG-XX"" formatted strings from the `in_scope` list for easier comparison.
3.  **Evaluation Functions:** Each function corresponds to a section in the JSON submission and the evaluation criteria:
    *   `evaluate_json_structure`: Checks top-level keys and basic types against the key file.
    *   `evaluate_scope`: Checks `in_scope` (RG IDs, keywords like browsers) and `out_of_scope` (keywords like mobile, auth). Uses weighting for RG IDs vs. other keywords.
    *   `evaluate_approach`: Checks `primary_focus` for required testing types and `methodology` for plausibility.
    *   `evaluate_prioritization`: Checks if all expected RG IDs are present, if priorities are integers, and does a basic check on the order (e.g., if the top 1 or 2 match the key).
    *   `evaluate_schedule`: Performs multiple checks: date format (YYYY-MM-DD), dates within QA window, start date <= end date, and basic coverage of expected activity types (design, execution, browser, regression, etc.). It returns two scores (one for format/window, one for activity coverage) which are summed up.
    *   `evaluate_risks_assumptions`: Checks if the minimum number of valid assumptions and risks are provided.
4.  **Main Execution (`main` function):**
    *   Uses `argparse` to get the submission and key file paths from the command line.
    *   Initializes the `results` dictionary.
    *   Loads both JSON files, handling errors gracefully.
    *   Calls each evaluation function, passing the relevant sections of the candidate and key data.
    *   Safely gets sections using `.get()` or checks for `None` to handle potentially missing sections in the candidate's submission.
    *   Accumulates the scores.
    *   Calculates the final `overall_score` percentage.
    *   Saves the detailed `results` dictionary to `test_results.json`.
    *   Prints a summary message and the overall score to the console.

**To Use:**

1.  Save the code above as `task_evaluation.py`.
2.  Make sure you have the candidate's submission file (e.g., `test_submission.json`) and the answer key file (you'll need to create this based on the `<evaluation_information>` section, let's call it `answer_key.json`) in the same directory.
3.  Run from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python task_evaluation.py test_submission.json answer_key.json
    ```
4.  A `test_results.json` file will be created in the same directory with the detailed scoring and the overall percentage.","{'exam_type': 'basic', 'candidate_id': 'EVALUATION_KEY', 'project_feature': 'Reading Goals Tracker', 'testing_scope': {'in_scope': [""RG-01: Navigate to 'My Reading Goals' page from dashboard"", ""RG-02: Set annual 'Books to Read This Year' goal (positive integer, savable, one per year)"", ""RG-03: Display goal number and current progress count on 'My Reading Goals' page"", ""RG-04: Increment progress count when user marks a book as 'read' via existing functionality"", 'RG-05: Progress display updates after marking book as read (auto or refresh)', 'RG-06: Edit/change saved goal number for the current year', 'Basic usability testing (clarity, intuitive flow)', 'Browser compatibility testing on latest stable Google Chrome', 'Browser compatibility testing on latest stable Mozilla Firefox'], 'out_of_scope': ['Mobile application testing', 'Browser compatibility testing on browsers other than Chrome/Firefox (e.g., Safari, Edge, IE)', 'User authentication (login/logout/registration)', 'Performance / Load testing', 'Major UI redesign / Extensive usability testing', 'Data migration testing', ""Testing the existing 'mark book as read' functionality itself (only its effect on the goal count)""]}, 'test_approach_summary': {'primary_focus': ['Functional Testing', 'Browser Compatibility Testing', 'Basic Usability Testing', 'Integration Testing (related to RG-04)'], 'methodology': 'Manual testing based on requirements, supplemented with exploratory testing.'}, 'prioritized_requirements': [{'requirement_id': 'RG-01', 'priority': 1}, {'requirement_id': 'RG-02', 'priority': 2}, {'requirement_id': 'RG-04', 'priority': 3}, {'requirement_id': 'RG-03', 'priority': 4}, {'requirement_id': 'RG-05', 'priority': 5}, {'requirement_id': 'RG-06', 'priority': 6}], 'test_schedule': [{'activity': 'Test Planning & Test Case Design/Review', 'start': '2024-07-30', 'end': '2024-07-31'}, {'activity': 'Functional Execution (RG-01, RG-02, RG-04 - Core)', 'start': '2024-08-01', 'end': '2024-08-02'}, {'activity': 'Functional Execution (RG-03, RG-05, RG-06 - Supporting)', 'start': '2024-08-05', 'end': '2024-08-05'}, {'activity': 'Browser Compatibility Checks (Chrome, Firefox)', 'start': '2024-08-06', 'end': '2024-08-06'}, {'activity': ""Regression Testing (Focus on dashboard link & 'mark as read' integration)"", 'start': '2024-08-07', 'end': '2024-08-07'}, {'activity': 'Buffer / Defect Retesting', 'start': '2024-08-08', 'end': '2024-08-08'}, {'activity': 'Final Test Summary Report Preparation', 'start': '2024-08-09', 'end': '2024-08-09'}], 'risks_and_assumptions': {'assumptions': ['The development build containing the feature will be delivered and deployed to the test environment by the start of QA Testing (2024-07-30).', 'The test environment will be stable and representative of the production configuration.', 'The provided requirements (RG-01 to RG-06) are complete, unambiguous, and will not change significantly during the testing phase.', 'Access to necessary test accounts and tools will be available.'], 'risks': ['Delay in receiving the test build from development, compressing the test execution window.', 'Discovery of critical/blocking defects early in the cycle, preventing progress on other test activities.', 'Test environment instability or significant differences from production.', 'Underestimation of time required for testing or defect retesting within the 9-day window for a single QA resource.']}}",[],True,True,0.0,99.0,100.0,1.0,False,"Could not parse JSON.

**Information Technology Project Manager - Practical Exam (Basic Level)**

**Assessment Area:** Customer Needs Assessment

**Duration:** 90 Minutes

**Instructions for the Candidate:**

**1. Exam Objective:**

This practical exam assesses your ability to analyze initial customer feedback, plan further data collection through a survey, and perform preliminary prioritization of potential requirements based on provided information. You will simulate the early stages of understanding customer needs for a hypothetical IT project.

**2. Permitted Tools:**

*   A text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code, TextEdit)
*   Spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc) - *Optional, for organizing your thoughts.*

**3. Provided Materials:**

You will be provided with two digital files:

*   `scenario_description.txt`: This file describes the context of a hypothetical IT project, including its high-level goals and the current situation regarding customer requirements.
*   `initial_feedback.txt`: This file contains raw, unstructured feedback snippets collected from initial interactions with potential users or customers related to the project described in the scenario.

**4. Your Tasks:**

Based *only* on the information provided in `scenario_description.txt` and `initial_feedback.txt`, you must complete the following three tasks:

*   **Task 1: Analyze Initial Feedback:**
    *   Read through the `initial_feedback.txt`.
    *   Identify key themes or recurring topics mentioned in the feedback.
    *   For each theme, identify the specific feedback snippets that support it.
    *   Determine the potential customer need or pain point suggested by each theme.

*   **Task 2: Plan Further Data Collection (Survey Design):**
    *   Define a clear goal for a follow-up survey aimed at gathering more specific information about customer needs and priorities related to the project scenario.
    *   Design **5 to 7 survey questions** that directly address the project goal and the insights gained from the initial feedback analysis (Task 1).
    *   For each question, specify:
        *   The question number.
        *   The exact question text.
        *   The question type. You **must** use one of the following predefined types:
            *   `Rating Scale (1-5)`
            *   `Multiple Choice (Single Select)`
            *   `Multiple Choice (Multi-Select)`
            *   `Open Text`
        *   If using Multiple Choice, list the options you would provide.
        *   A brief statement explaining the purpose of the question (i.e., what information you aim to gather with it).

*   **Task 3: Preliminary Prioritization:**
    *   Based on the `scenario_description.txt` and your analysis of `initial_feedback.txt`, identify potential requirements or areas of focus for the project.
    *   Create a preliminary prioritized list of these items (aim for 3-5 items).
    *   For each item, assign a priority level. You **must** use one of the following predefined levels:
        *   `High`
        *   `Medium`
        *   `Low`
    *   For each item, provide supporting evidence by referencing specific feedback snippets (you can quote them briefly or refer to their implicit content) from `initial_feedback.txt` or relevant statements from `scenario_description.txt`.

**5. Submission Format:**

*   You must submit your answers as a single JSON file named `test_submission.json`.
*   Use your text editor to create this file. Ensure the JSON structure exactly matches the template provided below.

Project Context: Enhance the ""NovaTime"" Internal Time Tracking Portal

Company: SynthoTech Inc.

Background:
SynthoTech uses an internally developed web portal called ""NovaTime"" for all employees to log their hours against specific project codes. This data is crucial for project costing, client billing, and resource management. The portal was developed several years ago and has not seen significant updates recently.

Current Situation:
Management has received anecdotal feedback suggesting employees find the NovaTime portal cumbersome and inefficient. There are concerns about user adoption rates (some employees log time infrequently, leading to inaccurate estimates) and the overall quality of the data captured. While the system is functional, there's a belief that significant improvements are needed to make it a more effective tool.

Project Goal:
The primary goal of this initiative is to identify and prioritize key improvements for the NovaTime portal to enhance user experience, increase efficiency for employees logging time, and improve the accuracy and reliability of the time tracking data. There is currently no defined list of specific requirements. Your task begins with understanding the user base's needs and pain points based on initial feedback.

Target Users: All SynthoTech employees who bill time to projects (approx. 500 users across various departments).
```

**File 2: `initial_feedback.txt`**

```text
Raw Feedback Snippets regarding NovaTime Portal:

[FDBK_01]: ""Logging my time at the end of the day takes way too long. I have to click through so many screens just to add time for one project task. It's easily 10-15 minutes wasted.""

[FDBK_02]: ""The overall look is very dated. It feels clunky, and sometimes I'm not sure which button I'm supposed to press to submit my timesheet.""

[FDBK_03]: ""I travel a lot for client meetings. It's impossible to log time easily when I'm not at my desk. I wish I could just quickly add entries from my phone right after a meeting.""

[FDBK_04]: ""The system becomes incredibly slow, almost unusable, late in the afternoon, especially on Thursdays and Fridays. Trying to submit my timesheet before leaving is frustrating.""

[FDBK_05]: ""Why can't I easily see a summary of my hours for the week broken down by project? I need this for my own records, but the portal doesn't offer a simple view like that. Generating reports seems impossible for regular users.""

[FDBK_06]: ""It works okay for basic entry. No major complaints from my side.""

[FDBK_07]: ""Making corrections is a nightmare. If I accidentally submit my timesheet before it's complete, getting it back, editing it, and resubmitting involves way too many steps and approvals.""

[FDBK_08]: ""The dropdown list for project codes is massive and in a random order. Finding the right code takes ages, and I've picked the wrong one by mistake more than once because I was rushing.""

[FDBK_09]: ""Honestly, the biggest issue is remembering to do it. Because it's such a hassle, I often put it off until Friday afternoon and then struggle to remember exactly what I worked on early in the week. My submitted hours are probably not very accurate sometimes.""

[FDBK_10]: ""Sometimes the project codes I need aren't even in the system yet, especially for new projects. I have to chase finance to get them added.""
```

Okay, here are the specific instructions regarding the submission format for the Basic Level practical exam.

You can use the feedback identifiers (`[FDBK_01]`, etc.) and/or quote relevant text snippets or scenario points.","You are an excellent examiner of Information Technology Project Managers capabilities. Design a remote, **practical** exam to verify whether a Information Technology Project Managers can Assess current or future customer needs and priorities by communicating directly with customers, conducting surveys, or other methods..
    This exam will have two parts (basic and advanced). Your current task is **only** to design the basic exam.

    ### Context
    - The candidate has access to a computer with the following tools: Spreadsheets and Text editor
    - The candidate can also be given digital materials such as Text or Data that must be used for the test.
    - Design a **practical** exam that can be completed remotely using only these tools. A practical exam is an exam actually testing whether the described task can be performed successfully. An exam testing knowledge about the task is NOT a practical exam.
    - To simplify evaluation, the candidate should submit answers in a structured JSON format. Name the file ""test_submission.json"".
    - The candidate should be able to complete the exam in maximum 90 minutes.
    ","Okay, here is the design for the **Basic Level** practical exam focusing on assessing customer needs and priorities.

**Examiner Briefing Document**

**1. Exam Purpose:**

This basic-level practical exam aims to evaluate a candidate's fundamental ability to process initial customer input, identify potential needs and pain points, plan a structured method (a survey) to gather further information, and perform a preliminary prioritization based on the limited data available. It simulates the early stages of requirements gathering for an IT project.

**2. Exam Structure:**

*   **Format:** Remote, practical assessment.
*   **Duration:** 90 minutes maximum.
*   **Tools Allowed:** Text editor, Spreadsheet software.
*   **Provided Materials:**
    *   `scenario_description.txt`: A text file describing a hypothetical IT project context (e.g., improving an internal tool, developing a feature for an existing customer-facing application). It will outline the high-level goal and the current lack of detailed requirements.
    *   `initial_feedback.txt`: A text file containing raw, unstructured feedback snippets supposedly gathered from a few initial customer/user interactions (e.g., email excerpts, brief meeting notes, support ticket comments).
*   **Tasks:** The candidate will perform three distinct tasks based on the provided materials:
    1.  **Analyze Initial Feedback:** Identify key themes, potential needs, or pain points expressed in the `initial_feedback.txt`.
    2.  **Plan Further Data Collection (Survey Design):** Design a short, focused survey (5-7 questions) aimed at gathering more specific information about the needs and priorities related to the project described in the scenario.
    3.  **Preliminary Prioritization:** Based *only* on the provided `scenario_description.txt` and `initial_feedback.txt`, create a preliminary list of potential requirements or areas of focus and assign a basic priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low) with justification.
*   **Deliverable:** A single JSON file named `test_submission.json` containing the structured output from all three tasks.

**3. Evaluation Focus:**

The evaluation will focus on:

*   **Task 1 (Analysis):** Ability to extract meaningful information (needs, pain points, themes) from unstructured text.
*   **Task 2 (Survey Design):** Ability to formulate clear, relevant, and appropriately typed questions (e.g., multiple-choice, rating scale, open-ended) that logically follow from the scenario and initial feedback to gather actionable data.
*   **Task 3 (Prioritization):** Ability to synthesize the limited information, make reasonable judgments about importance based on the scenario's context, and clearly justify the assigned priorities.
*   **Overall:** Clarity of thought, structured approach (reflected in the JSON output), and adherence to instructions.

**4. Practical Nature:**

This exam is practical because the candidate is not asked *about* requirements gathering methods; they are required to *perform* core activities involved: analyzing actual (simulated) feedback, designing a data collection instrument (survey questions), and making prioritization decisions based on the given inputs. The use of basic tools (text editor, potentially spreadsheet for organizing thoughts) mirrors realistic constraints in some environments.

      }
      // ... potentially 1-2 more items
    ]
  }
}

**Information Technology Project Manager - Practical Exam (Basic Level)**

**Assessment Area:** Customer Needs Assessment

**Duration:** 90 Minutes

**Instructions for the Candidate:**

**1. Exam Objective:**

This practical exam assesses your ability to analyze initial customer feedback, plan further data collection through a survey, and perform preliminary prioritization of potential requirements based on provided information. You will simulate the early stages of understanding customer needs for a hypothetical IT project.

**2. Permitted Tools:**

*   A text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code, TextEdit)
*   Spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc) - *Optional, for organizing your thoughts.*

**3. Provided Materials:**

You will be provided with two digital files:

*   `scenario_description.txt`: This file describes the context of a hypothetical IT project, including its high-level goals and the current situation regarding customer requirements.
*   `initial_feedback.txt`: This file contains raw, unstructured feedback snippets collected from initial interactions with potential users or customers related to the project described in the scenario.

**4. Your Tasks:**

Based *only* on the information provided in `scenario_description.txt` and `initial_feedback.txt`, you must complete the following three tasks:

*   **Task 1: Analyze Initial Feedback:**
    *   Read through the `initial_feedback.txt`.
    *   Identify key themes or recurring topics mentioned in the feedback.
    *   For each theme, identify the specific feedback snippets that support it.
    *   Determine the potential customer need or pain point suggested by each theme.

*   **Task 2: Plan Further Data Collection (Survey Design):**
    *   Define a clear goal for a follow-up survey aimed at gathering more specific information about customer needs and priorities related to the project scenario.
    *   Design **5 to 7 survey questions** that directly address the project goal and the insights gained from the initial feedback analysis (Task 1).
    *   For each question, specify:
        *   The question number.
        *   The exact question text.
        *   The question type. You **must** use one of the following predefined types:
            *   `Rating Scale (1-5)`
            *   `Multiple Choice (Single Select)`
            *   `Multiple Choice (Multi-Select)`
            *   `Open Text`
        *   If using Multiple Choice, list the options you would provide.
        *   A brief statement explaining the purpose of the question (i.e., what information you aim to gather with it).

*   **Task 3: Preliminary Prioritization:**
    *   Based on the `scenario_description.txt` and your analysis of `initial_feedback.txt`, identify potential requirements or areas of focus for the project.
    *   Create a preliminary prioritized list of these items (aim for 3-5 items).
    *   For each item, assign a priority level. You **must** use one of the following predefined levels:
        *   `High`
        *   `Medium`
        *   `Low`
    *   For each item, provide supporting evidence by referencing specific feedback snippets (you can quote them briefly or refer to their implicit content) from `initial_feedback.txt` or relevant statements from `scenario_description.txt`.

**5. Submission Format:**

*   You must submit your answers as a single JSON file named `test_submission.json`.
*   Use your text editor to create this file. Ensure the JSON structure exactly matches the template provided below.
*   Replace placeholder text (like `""CANDIDATE_ID_HERE""`, `""Example: ...""`, `""Quote...""`, etc.) with your actual analysis and responses.
*   If you have a candidate ID, please include it; otherwise, leave `""CANDIDATE_ID_HERE""` as is.

Project Context: Enhance the ""NovaTime"" Internal Time Tracking Portal

Company: SynthoTech Inc.

Background:
SynthoTech uses an internally developed web portal called ""NovaTime"" for all employees to log their hours against specific project codes. This data is crucial for project costing, client billing, and resource management. The portal was developed several years ago and has not seen significant updates recently.

Current Situation:
Management has received anecdotal feedback suggesting employees find the NovaTime portal cumbersome and inefficient. There are concerns about user adoption rates (some employees log time infrequently, leading to inaccurate estimates) and the overall quality of the data captured. While the system is functional, there's a belief that significant improvements are needed to make it a more effective tool.

Project Goal:
The primary goal of this initiative is to identify and prioritize key improvements for the NovaTime portal to enhance user experience, increase efficiency for employees logging time, and improve the accuracy and reliability of the time tracking data. There is currently no defined list of specific requirements. Your task begins with understanding the user base's needs and pain points based on initial feedback.

Target Users: All SynthoTech employees who bill time to projects (approx. 500 users across various departments).

Raw Feedback Snippets regarding NovaTime Portal:

[FDBK_01]: ""Logging my time at the end of the day takes way too long. I have to click through so many screens just to add time for one project task. It's easily 10-15 minutes wasted.""

[FDBK_02]: ""The overall look is very dated. It feels clunky, and sometimes I'm not sure which button I'm supposed to press to submit my timesheet.""

[FDBK_03]: ""I travel a lot for client meetings. It's impossible to log time easily when I'm not at my desk. I wish I could just quickly add entries from my phone right after a meeting.""

[FDBK_04]: ""The system becomes incredibly slow, almost unusable, late in the afternoon, especially on Thursdays and Fridays. Trying to submit my timesheet before leaving is frustrating.""

[FDBK_05]: ""Why can't I easily see a summary of my hours for the week broken down by project? I need this for my own records, but the portal doesn't offer a simple view like that. Generating reports seems impossible for regular users.""

[FDBK_06]: ""It works okay for basic entry. No major complaints from my side.""

[FDBK_07]: ""Making corrections is a nightmare. If I accidentally submit my timesheet before it's complete, getting it back, editing it, and resubmitting involves way too many steps and approvals.""

[FDBK_08]: ""The dropdown list for project codes is massive and in a random order. Finding the right code takes ages, and I've picked the wrong one by mistake more than once because I was rushing.""

[FDBK_09]: ""Honestly, the biggest issue is remembering to do it. Because it's such a hassle, I often put it off until Friday afternoon and then struggle to remember exactly what I worked on early in the week. My submitted hours are probably not very accurate sometimes.""

[FDBK_10]: ""Sometimes the project codes I need aren't even in the system yet, especially for new projects. I have to chase finance to get them added.""
```

</MATERIALS_FOR_CANDIDATE>

<MATERIALS_EXPLANATION_FOR_EVALUATOR>
**1. Material Creation & Design:**

*   **`scenario_description.txt`:** This sets a clear, common IT project context (internal tool enhancement). It establishes the *business need* (better data for costing/billing, resource management) and the *user problem* (cumbersome, inefficient, potential data inaccuracy). The goal explicitly states the need to identify and prioritize improvements, directly linking to the exam tasks. It avoids specifying solutions, forcing the candidate to derive needs from feedback.
*   **`initial_feedback.txt`:** This file contains ten distinct feedback snippets, each tagged with a unique identifier (`[FDBK_XX]`) for easy reference by the candidate and evaluator. The snippets were crafted to represent a mix of common issues found in such systems:
    *   **Core Usability/Efficiency:** Snippets `[FDBK_01]`, `[FDBK_07]`, `[FDBK_08]`, `[FDBK_09]` directly address difficulties in the primary task of logging and managing time.
    *   **User Interface (UI):** Snippet `[FDBK_02]` mentions the dated look and button confusion.
    *   **Missing Features:** Snippets `[FDBK_03]` (Mobile Access) and `[FDBK_05]` (User Reporting) request functionality not currently present.
    *   **Performance:** Snippet `[FDBK_04]` points to speed issues at peak times.
    *   **Data Accuracy/Integrity:** Snippets `[FDBK_08]` (selecting wrong code due to UI) and `[FDBK_09]` (forgetting/guessing due to hassle) link usability to data quality. Snippet `[FDBK_10]` relates to data integrity but points to an external process (code creation).
    *   **Neutral Feedback:** Snippet `[FDBK_06]` provides a contrasting neutral viewpoint.

**2. Predictable Outcomes & Expected Analysis:**

*   **Task 1 (Feedback Analysis):** Candidates should identify recurring themes like:
    *   *Time-Consuming Data Entry:* Supported by `[FDBK_01]`, `[FDBK_09]`. Need: Faster time logging process.
    *   *Difficult Navigation/UI:* Supported by `[FDBK_02]`, `[FDBK_08]`. Need: Improved interface clarity, searchable project codes.
    *   *Lack of Mobile Access:* Supported by `[FDBK_03]`. Need: Mobile capability.
    *   *Poor Performance:* Supported by `[FDBK_04]`. Need: Improved system responsiveness.
    *   *Inadequate Reporting:* Supported by `[FDBK_05]`. Need: User-accessible reporting features.
    *   *Complex Correction/Workflow:* Supported by `[FDBK_07]`. Need: Simplified timesheet editing/approval process.
    *   *Impact on Data Accuracy:* Supported by `[FDBK_08]`, `[FDBK_09]`. Need: Features that facilitate accurate and timely entry.
*   **Task 2 (Survey Design):** Questions should aim to quantify the issues and gauge demand. Examples:
    *   Rating scale for ease of use (overall, specific tasks like entry/editing).
    *   Rating scale for importance of mobile access, reporting.
    *   Multiple choice identifying most time-consuming parts of the process.
    *   Frequency question (How often do you need to edit submitted timesheets?).
    *   Open text for the single biggest improvement desired.
    *   Questions should clearly link back to the themes identified in Task 1 and the overall goal from the scenario.
*   **Task 3 (Prioritization):** Based *only* on the provided materials:
    *   *High Priority:* Likely focus on core usability/efficiency issues impacting daily work and accuracy (`[FDBK_01]`, `[FDBK_07]`, `[FDBK_08]`, `[FDBK_09]`). These directly impede the primary function and affect data quality mentioned in the scenario.
    *   *Medium Priority:* Performance (`[FDBK_04]`), Mobile Access (`[FDBK_03]`), User Reporting (`[FDBK_05]`). These are significant but might affect fewer users daily or require more investigation (feasibility/demand).
    *   *Low Priority:* UI Refresh (`[FDBK_02]`) - often secondary to core function; Addressing missing project codes (`[FDBK_10]`) - likely an external process issue, not a portal software fix (though the portal *could* potentially help flag missing codes). Neutral feedback (`[FDBK_06]`) should not drive priority.
    *   Justification must reference specific feedback snippets (`[FDBK_XX]`) and/or the scenario description.

**3. Tricky Elements & Common Pitfalls:**

*   **Ignoring the Scenario Context:** Candidates might prioritize based solely on feedback frequency without considering the project goals (efficiency, accuracy).
*   **Getting Sidetracked by `[FDBK_10]`:** This snippet relates to project codes *not being available*. While a valid user pain point, fixing the *process* of code creation might be outside the scope of *enhancing the portal software itself*. A good candidate might note this distinction or suggest a portal feature to *handle* missing codes gracefully (e.g., temporary codes, notifications), rather than assuming the portal team can fix the finance process.
*   **Over-prioritizing UI:** Focusing too much on `[FDBK_02]` (dated look) over functional issues (`[FDBK_01]`, `[FDBK_07]`, `[FDBK_08]`).
*   **Vague Survey Questions:** Designing questions that don't elicit specific, actionable information (e.g., ""Is the portal good? Y/N"").
*   **Ignoring Neutral Feedback:** Incorrectly trying to assign a need or priority based on `[FDBK_06]`.
*   **JSON Formatting Errors:** Candidates must strictly adhere to the provided JSON structure, including the predefined `question_type` and `priority` values.

**4. Hidden Information/Careful Reading:**

*   The link between usability issues (`[FDBK_01]`, `[FDBK_09]`) and data accuracy (mentioned in the scenario and implied in `[FDBK_09]`) is important for justification in Task 3.
*   The scenario mentions the goal of improving *adoption* – feedback `[FDBK_09]` (forgetting due to hassle) directly relates to this.
*   Recognizing that `[FDBK_08]` (selecting wrong code) is both a usability issue (bad dropdown) *and* a data accuracy issue.

By using these materials, the evaluator can assess the candidate's ability to systematically analyze unstructured input, formulate targeted questions to gather more data, and make reasoned preliminary prioritization decisions based on evidence, all within the constraints of a basic IT project management context.

**2. Explanation of Correct Answers and Derivations**

*   **Task 1: Feedback Analysis**
    *   **Themes:** The key identifies major distinct problem areas mentioned in the feedback. Themes like ""Inefficient Time Logging,"" ""Project Code Selection,"" ""Mobile Access,"" ""Correction Process,"" ""Performance,"" and ""Reporting"" directly map to specific user complaints (`[FDBK_01]`, `[FDBK_08]`, `[FDBK_03]`, `[FDBK_07]`, `[FDBK_04]`, `[FDBK_05]`). Other valid themes could include ""General Usability/UI"" (combining `[FDBK_02]` and `[FDBK_08]`) or ""Data Accuracy Concerns"" (linking `[FDBK_08]` and `[FDBK_09]`).
    *   **Supporting Snippets:** The key links each theme to the most direct quotes. Candidates must select quotes that clearly illustrate the theme.
    *   **Inferred Need:** This requires interpreting the user's complaint into a requirement or goal. For example, ""takes way too long"" (`[FDBK_01]`) translates to a need for a ""faster, simpler way to log time.""

*   **Task 2: Survey Design**
    *   **Survey Goal:** The goal must reflect the project's objective (improve NovaTime based on user needs) and the purpose of a follow-up survey (quantify issues, gauge demand, prioritize). The key provides a comprehensive example.
    *   **Survey Questions:**
        *   The key includes 6 questions (within the 5-7 range).
        *   Each question targets information gaps or seeks to quantify issues raised in Task 1 (e.g., Q1 quantifies time from `[FDBK_01]`, Q2 rates difficulty from `[FDBK_08]`, Q3 gauges demand from `[FDBK_03]`, Q4 assesses frequency related to `[FDBK_07]`, Q5 quantifies performance from `[FDBK_04]`).
        *   An open-ended question (Q6) is included to capture unexpected priorities.
        *   Question types are used appropriately (Rating Scale for opinions/importance, Multiple Choice for quantifiable options, Open Text for freeform input).
        *   Options for Multiple Choice questions are logical and cover a reasonable range.
        *   The `purpose` clearly links the question back to the information needed.

*   **Task 3: Preliminary Prioritization**
    *   **Items:** The key identifies 5 potential focus areas (within the 3-5 range) derived directly from the analysis in Task 1.
    *   **Priority Levels:**
        *   `High` is assigned to core functionality issues that impact efficiency and data accuracy, mentioned strongly in feedback and aligned with primary project goals (Time Entry Efficiency, Project Code Selection). These are fundamental to the tool's purpose.
        *   `Medium` is assigned to significant pain points or feature requests that need further validation (survey) or investigation (technical performance) before committing major resources (Corrections, Performance, Mobile Access). While important, their impact might be less universal or require more data.
        *   `Low` (not used in this key's top 5, but could be applied to UI look-and-feel `[FDBK_02]` or user reporting `[FDBK_05]` if extending the list) would be for items less critical to core function or data accuracy based *only* on the initial feedback.
    *   **Supporting Evidence:** Crucially, the justification for each priority level *must* reference specific feedback (`[FDBK_XX]`) and/or statements from the `scenario_description.txt`. This demonstrates evidence-based decision-making. For example, prioritizing Project Code Selection as High is justified by `[FDBK_08]` (difficulty/errors) and the scenario's goal of improving data accuracy.

**3. Passing Criteria (Basic Level)**

To pass this basic level exam, the candidate must demonstrate a fundamental ability to perform each task logically and follow instructions. Perfection is not expected, but core competence is.

*   **Overall:**
    *   Submission is a single, valid `test_submission.json` file.
    *   All required top-level keys (`exam_candidate_id`, `assessment_area`, `task_1_feedback_analysis`, `task_2_survey_design`, `task_3_preliminary_prioritization`) are present.
    *   `exam_candidate_id` is correctly filled with the provided model name.
    *   `assessment_area` value is unchanged.

*   **Task 1: Feedback Analysis:**
    *   Identifies at least **3 distinct and relevant themes** based on the provided feedback.
    *   For each identified theme, provides at least **one correct supporting feedback snippet** reference (`[FDBK_XX]` or quote).
    *   For each identified theme, provides a **logically inferred need or pain point**.
    *   JSON structure for `task_1_feedback_analysis` is correct.

*   **Task 2: Survey Design:**
    *   Provides a **relevant survey goal** aligned with the scenario.
    *   Includes **exactly 5, 6, or 7 survey questions**.
    *   For at least **4** of the questions:
        *   The question text is clear and relevant to the scenario/feedback.
        *   An **allowed `question_type`** is correctly specified.
        *   `options` are provided correctly (array of strings for Multiple Choice, `null` otherwise).
        *   A **logical `purpose`** is stated.
    *   JSON structure for `task_2_survey_design` is correct.

*   **Task 3: Preliminary Prioritization:**
    *   Includes **exactly 3, 4, or 5 prioritized items**.
    *   For at least **3** of the items:
        *   The `requirement_or_focus_area` is relevant to the scenario/feedback.
        *   An **allowed `priority` level** (`High`, `Medium`, `Low`) is assigned. The assigned priorities should be generally justifiable, even if not identical to the key (e.g., swapping Mediums is acceptable, but calling core efficiency Low would be questionable).
        *   The `supporting_evidence` array contains **at least one specific reference** to either `initial_feedback.txt` (using `[FDBK_XX]` or quote) or `scenario_description.txt` that logically supports the item and its priority.
    *   JSON structure for `task_3_preliminary_prioritization` is correct.

**Summary Passing Threshold:** The candidate passes if they meet the ""Overall"" criteria AND the minimum requirements specified for **all three tasks** (Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3). Failure to meet the minimum in any single task results in failing the exam, as it indicates a gap in a fundamental part of the assessment process. Minor errors in JSON syntax (e.g., a missing comma) might be overlooked if the structure and content are otherwise sound and meet the criteria, depending on evaluator discretion and tooling. However, strict adherence is preferred.","```python

**Explanation:**

1.  **Imports:** Imports `json` for JSON handling, `sys` for command-line arguments, `os` for file path checks, and `typing` for type hints.
2.  **Constants:** Defines constants based on the evaluation criteria (allowed values, minimum/maximum counts) for easy modification and clarity.
3.  **Helper Functions:**
    *   `load_json`: Safely loads a JSON file, handling `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`. Returns `None` on error.
    *   `check_structure`: Basic type checking.
    *   `check_string`: Checks if a value is a non-empty string.
    *   `check_list`: Checks if a value is a list, optionally validating length and element types.
    *   `check_allowed_values`: Checks if a string value is within a predefined list.
    *   These helpers print informative error messages during checks.
4.  **Evaluation Functions (`evaluate_task_1`, `evaluate_task_2`, `evaluate_task_3`, `evaluate_overall_structure`):**
    *   Each function takes the relevant part of the submission data.
    *   They initialize `results`, `score`, and `max_score`.
    *   They perform checks based *directly* on the criteria outlined in the `<evaluation_information>` section (e.g., checking list lengths, allowed values, presence of keys, basic types).
    *   Each check updates the `results` dictionary with details (`achieved` points, `max` points, `passed` status, `comment`).
    *   Scores are incremented for passed checks.
    *   They handle cases where expected data structures are missing or invalid, preventing crashes and assigning 0 points for dependent checks.
    *   They return the detailed results dictionary, the achieved score, and the maximum possible score for that section.
5.  **`main()` Function:**
    *   Parses command-line arguments (`sys.argv`).
    *   Loads the submission and key JSON files using `load_json`. Exits if loading fails.
    *   Initializes `evaluation_results`, `total_score`, and `total_max_score`.
    *   Calls `evaluate_overall_structure` first. If basic structure fails (missing top-level keys), it stops further evaluation.
    *   Calls the evaluation functions for each task, accumulating scores and results.
    *   Calculates the `overall_percentage`.
    *   Adds the overall score and total points to the final results dictionary.
    *   Saves the `evaluation_results` dictionary to `test_results.json` using `json.dump` with indentation for readability.
    *   Prints completion status and the overall score to the console.
6.  **`if __name__ == ""__main__"":`:** Standard Python practice to ensure `main()` runs only when the script is executed directly.

This script directly implements the scoring logic described in the evaluation criteria, focusing on the objective, automatable checks (structure, counts, allowed values, presence of data) rather than subjective quality assessment.","{'exam_candidate_id': 'ANSWER_KEY_V1.0', 'assessment_area': 'Customer Needs Assessment - Basic', 'task_1_feedback_analysis': {'identified_themes': [{'theme_name': 'Inefficient Time Logging Process', 'supporting_feedback_snippets': ['[FDBK_01]: ""Logging my time at the end of the day takes way too long.

## Candidate Exam Instructions: Basic Level

**Objective:**

This exam assesses your ability to analyze predefined sets of mathematical assumptions and determine their direct logical consequences based on provided materials.

**Materials Provided:**

*   You will receive one PDF document: `source_material.pdf`.
*   This document contains:
    *   Basic mathematical definitions.
    *   A list of five potential **Assumptions**, labeled `A1`, `A2`, `A3`, `A4`, `A5`.
    *   A list of six potential **Consequences**, labeled `C1`, `C2`, `C3`, `C4`, `C5`, `C6`.

**Your Task:**

You must analyze **two specific sets** of assumptions, defined below, using the information in `source_material.pdf`.

1.  **Set 1 Assumptions:** `{A1, A3}`
2.  **Set 2 Assumptions:** `{A1, A2, A4}`

For **each** of these two sets:

*   Identify which of the Consequences (`C1` through `C6`) are logically derivable *using only the assumptions within that specific set*.
*   For each consequence you identify as derivable, determine the **minimal subset** of assumptions *from that specific set* that are necessary and sufficient to derive it.

**Submission Format:**

*   You must submit your answers in a single JSON file named `test_submission.json`.
*   The file must strictly adhere to the structure specified below. Use the exact labels (`A1`, `C1`, etc.) as provided in `source_material.pdf`.

**JSON Output Structure:**

        }
        // ... add more objects if other consequences from C1-C6 are derivable from Set 2
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Important Notes:**

*   You do **not** need to provide proofs or justifications, only the identified consequences and the minimal assumptions required for them, formatted correctly in the JSON file.
*   Focus solely on the assumptions provided within each specific set when determining consequences. A consequence is only derivable from a set if it can be proven using *only* assumptions from that set.
*   The ""minimal required assumptions"" must be a subset of the `assumptions_in_set` for that specific `set_id`.

**Tools Allowed:**

*   PDF Viewer (to read `source_material.pdf`)
*   Text Editor (to create `test_submission.json`)

-----------------------------------------------------

**Document Purpose:** This document provides the definitions, assumptions, and potential consequences for your analysis task.

**Section 1: Definitions**

*   Let `S` be a non-empty set.
*   Let `*` be a binary operation defined on `S`, meaning that for any two elements `a, b` in `S`, `a * b` is also an element in `S`.

**Section 2: Potential Assumptions**

The following are statements about the properties of the set `S` and the operation `*`. You will use these as building blocks for your assumption sets.

*   **A1:** Associativity
    *   For all `a, b, c` in `S`, the following holds: `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)`.
*   **A2:** Commutativity
    *   For all `a, b` in `S`, the following holds: `a * b = b * a`.
*   **A3:** Existence of Identity Element
    *   There exists an element `e` in `S` such that for all `a` in `S`, `a * e = a` and `e * a = a`.
*   **A4:** Existence of Annihilator Element
    *   There exists an element `z` in `S` such that for all `a` in `S`, `a * z = z` and `z * a = z`.
*   **A5:** Idempotence
    *   For all `a` in `S`, the following holds: `a * a = a`.

**Section 3: Potential Consequences**

The following are statements that might logically follow from certain combinations of the assumptions listed above. Your task is to determine which of these follow from the specific assumption sets defined in the exam instructions.

*   **C1:** Uniqueness of Identity
    *   If an identity element `e` exists (as defined in A3), then it is unique. (Meaning, if `e'` is another element such that `a * e' = a` and `e' * a = a` for all `a`, then `e = e'`).
*   **C2:** Uniqueness of Annihilator
    *   If an annihilator element `z` exists (as defined in A4), then it is unique. (Meaning, if `z'` is another element such that `a * z' = z'` and `z' * a = z'` for all `a`, then `z = z'`).
*   **C3:** Identity is Idempotent
    *   If an identity element `e` exists (A3), then `e * e = e`.
*   **C4:** Annihilator is Idempotent
    *   If an annihilator element `z` exists (A4), then `z * z = z`.
*   **C5:** A specific rearrangement property
    *   For all `a, b, c` in `S`, the following holds: `(a * b) * c = a * (c * b)`.
*   **C6:** Idempotence of products
    *   For all `a, b` in `S`, the following holds: `(a * b) * (a * b) = a * b`.

    ### Context
    - The candidate has access to a computer with the following tools: Text editor and PDF viewer
    - The candidate can also be given digital materials such as Text that must be used for the test.
    - Design a **practical** exam that can be completed remotely using only these tools. A practical exam is an exam actually testing whether the described task can be performed successfully. An exam testing knowledge about the task is NOT a practical exam.
    - To simplify evaluation, the candidate should submit answers in a structured JSON format. Name the file ""test_submission.json"".
    - The candidate should be able to complete the exam in maximum 90 minutes.
    ","Okay, here is the design for the **Basic Exam** focusing on assembling assumption sets and exploring their consequences, along with the explanation for the evaluator.

## Explanation for the Evaluator

**Exam Purpose:**

This basic practical exam assesses a candidate's fundamental ability to:
1.  **Identify and Select Assumptions:** Choose relevant statements from a provided text to form distinct sets of foundational assumptions (axioms).
2.  **Logical Deduction:** Determine the direct logical consequences (simple theorems or properties) that follow specifically from each chosen set of assumptions.
3.  **Distinguish Systems:** Recognize how different sets of assumptions lead to different sets of valid consequences.
4.  **Structured Reporting:** Communicate their findings clearly in a machine-readable format (JSON).

The exam focuses on the *process* of working with assumptions and consequences in a controlled environment, rather than testing deep mathematical knowledge or complex proof techniques. The mathematical context is kept simple to ensure the focus remains on the core skill.

**Exam Structure:**

1.  **Input Material:** The candidate receives a single PDF document (`source_material.pdf`). This document contains:
    *   Basic definitions (e.g., a set `S`, a binary operation `*` on `S`).
    *   A list of potential **Assumptions** (labeled `A1`, `A2`, ... `A5`) regarding the properties of `S` and `*` (e.g., Associativity, Commutativity, Existence of an Identity element, etc.).
    *   A list of potential **Consequences** (labeled `C1`, `C2`, ... `C6`) which are statements that might or might not follow logically from various combinations of the assumptions.
2.  **Task:** The candidate must:
    *   Define **two distinct sets** of assumptions by selecting subsets from the provided list (`A1`...`A5`). Each set must contain at least two assumptions.
    *   For **each** assumption set they define:
        *   List the assumptions chosen for that set.
        *   Identify which of the listed Consequences (`C1`...`C6`) are logically derivable *using only the assumptions within that specific set*.
        *   For each consequence identified as following, they must specify the *minimal subset* of the chosen assumptions that are necessary and sufficient to derive it.
3.  **Output:** The candidate submits their analysis in a structured JSON file named `test_submission.json`.
4.  **Tools:** Candidate uses only a PDF viewer to read the material and a text editor to create the JSON submission file.
5.  **Time Limit:** 90 minutes.

**Evaluation Focus:**

*   Correctness of the identified consequences for each assumption set.
*   Accuracy in identifying the minimal required assumptions for each consequence derived.
*   Demonstration of understanding that different assumption sets yield different consequences.
*   Adherence to the specified JSON structure.
*   Logical consistency within each defined assumption system.

    *   Create **two distinct** sets of assumptions. Name them ""Set 1"" and ""Set 2"".
    *   Each set must be formed by selecting **at least two** assumptions from the list `A1` to `A5`.
    *   The two sets must be different from each other (i.e., they must not contain exactly the same assumptions).
3.  **Analyze Consequences:**
    *   For **each** of your defined sets (""Set 1"" and ""Set 2""):
        *   Determine which of the Consequences (`C1` to `C6`) logically follow *using only the assumptions included in that specific set*.
        *   For each consequence that you determine *does* follow from the set's assumptions, identify the **minimal subset** of assumptions *from that set* which are required to prove the consequence.
4.  **Format Your Submission:**
    *   Create a JSON file named `test_submission.json`.
    *   Structure the JSON according to the format specified below. Ensure the labels (`A1`, `C1`, etc.) match those in `source_material.pdf`.

</MATERIALS_FOR_CANDIDATE>

<MATERIALS_EXPLANATION_FOR_EVALUATOR>
**1. Material Creation and Structure:**

*   The `source_material.pdf` content was created to provide a simple, self-contained algebraic structure context (a set with a binary operation). This avoids requiring external mathematical knowledge beyond basic logic.
*   The assumptions (A1-A5) represent common algebraic properties (associativity, commutativity, identity, annihilator/zero, idempotence). They are chosen to have distinct and sometimes overlapping consequences.
*   The potential consequences (C1-C6) are simple theorems or properties that can be derived from subsets of the assumptions. They are designed such that:
    *   Some depend on only one assumption (C1, C2, C3, C4, C6).
    *   Some depend on multiple assumptions (C5).
    *   Not all consequences follow from every set of assumptions.
*   The labels (A1-A5, C1-C6) are clear identifiers to be used directly in the JSON output, preventing ambiguity and simplifying evaluation.

**2. Predefined Sets and Expected Outcomes:**

The candidate is given two specific sets to analyze:
*   **Set 1: `{A1, A3}`** (Associativity, Identity)
*   **Set 2: `{A1, A2, A4}`** (Associativity, Commutativity, Annihilator)

Here is the breakdown of expected derivable consequences and minimal required assumptions for each set:

*   **Analysis for Set 1: `{A1, A3}`**
    *   **C1 (Uniqueness of Identity):** Derivable. Requires only A3. Minimal: `[""A3""]`.
        *   *Logic:* The standard proof `e = e * e' = e'` uses only the properties defined in A3. A1 is not needed.
    *   **C2 (Uniqueness of Annihilator):** Not Derivable. Requires A4, which is not in the set.
    *   **C3 (Identity is Idempotent):** Derivable. Requires only A3. Minimal: `[""A3""]`.
        *   *Logic:* From A3, `a * e = a`. Substitute `a = e` to get `e * e = e`. A1 is not needed.
    *   **C4 (Annihilator is Idempotent):** Not Derivable. Requires A4, which is not in the set.
    *   **C5 (Rearrangement):** Not Derivable. Requires A2, which is not in the set.
    *   **C6 (Idempotence of products):** Not Derivable. Requires A5, which is not in the set.
    *   **Expected `derived_consequences` for Set 1:**
        ```json
        [
          { ""consequence_id"": ""C1"", ""minimal_required_assumptions"": [""A3""] },
          { ""consequence_id"": ""C3"", ""minimal_required_assumptions"": [""A3""] }
        ]
        ```

*   **Analysis for Set 2: `{A1, A2, A4}`**
    *   **C1 (Uniqueness of Identity):** Not Derivable. Requires A3, which is not in the set.
    *   **C2 (Uniqueness of Annihilator):** Derivable. Requires only A4. Minimal: `[""A4""]`.
        *   *Logic:* The standard proof `z = z' * z = z'` uses only the properties defined in A4. A1 and A2 are not needed.
    *   **C3 (Identity is Idempotent):** Not Derivable. Requires A3, which is not in the set.
    *   **C4 (Annihilator is Idempotent):** Derivable. Requires only A4. Minimal: `[""A4""]`.
        *   *Logic:* From A4, `a * z = z`. Substitute `a = z` to get `z * z = z`. A1 and A2 are not needed.
    *   **C5 (Rearrangement):** Derivable. Requires A1 and A2. Minimal: `[""A1"", ""A2""]`.
        *   *Logic:* `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)` (by A1). Then `a * (b * c) = a * (c * b)` (by A2 applied to `b*c`). A4 is not needed.
    *   **C6 (Idempotence of products):** Not Derivable. Requires A5, which is not in the set.
    *   **Expected `derived_consequences` for Set 2:**
        ```json
        [
          { ""consequence_id"": ""C2"", ""minimal_required_assumptions"": [""A4""] },
          { ""consequence_id"": ""C4"", ""minimal_required_assumptions"": [""A4""] },
          { ""consequence_id"": ""C5"", ""minimal_required_assumptions"": [""A1"", ""A2""] }
        ]
        ```

**3. Tricky Elements and Common Pitfalls:**

*   **Minimal Assumptions:** Candidates might incorrectly list *all* assumptions from the set instead of the minimal required subset. For example, for C1 in Set 1, listing `[""A1"", ""A3""]` is incorrect; only `[""A3""]` is needed. Similarly for C2/C4 in Set 2, listing `[""A1"", ""A2"", ""A4""]` or `[""A1"", ""A4""]` would be incorrect; only `[""A4""]` is needed. For C5 in Set 2, listing `[""A1"", ""A2"", ""A4""]` is incorrect; only `[""A1"", ""A2""]` are needed.
*   **Irrelevant Assumptions:** Candidates might think A1 (Associativity) is needed for proofs like C1 or C3, but it is not strictly required for those specific consequences.
*   **Misinterpreting Consequence C6:** C6 states `(a * b) * (a * b) = a * b`. This is a direct application of A5 (Idempotence) by substituting `x = a * b`. It does *not* require A1 (Associativity). If A5 were included in a set, the minimal requirement for C6 would just be `[""A5""]`. Since A5 is not in Set 1 or Set 2, C6 is not derivable in either case.
*   **JSON Format Errors:** Candidates must strictly adhere to the JSON structure, including correct nesting, key names, and using the exact labels (A1, C1, etc.).

**4. ""Hidden"" Information:**

*   There isn't truly ""hidden"" information, but the core task requires careful reading to distinguish between *being part of the assumption set* and *being necessary to derive a specific consequence*. The concept of a ""minimal subset"" is key and requires precise identification.
*   The definitions themselves are crucial context but are not labeled assumptions to be included in the sets.

-----------------------------------------------------

**Document Purpose:** This document provides the definitions, assumptions, and potential consequences for your analysis task.

**Section 1: Definitions**

*   Let `S` be a non-empty set.
*   Let `*` be a binary operation defined on `S`, meaning that for any two elements `a, b` in `S`, `a * b` is also an element in `S`.

**Section 2: Potential Assumptions**

The following are statements about the properties of the set `S` and the operation `*`. You will use these as building blocks for your assumption sets.

*   **A1:** Associativity
    *   For all `a, b, c` in `S`, the following holds: `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)`.
*   **A2:** Commutativity
    *   For all `a, b` in `S`, the following holds: `a * b = b * a`.
*   **A3:** Existence of Identity Element
    *   There exists an element `e` in `S` such that for all `a` in `S`, `a * e = a` and `e * a = a`.
*   **A4:** Existence of Annihilator Element
    *   There exists an element `z` in `S` such that for all `a` in `S`, `a * z = z` and `z * a = z`.
*   **A5:** Idempotence
    *   For all `a` in `S`, the following holds: `a * a = a`.

**Section 3: Potential Consequences**

The following are statements that might logically follow from certain combinations of the assumptions listed above. Your task is to determine which of these follow from the specific assumption sets defined in the exam instructions.

*   **C1:** Uniqueness of Identity
    *   If an identity element `e` exists (as defined in A3), then it is unique. (Meaning, if `e'` is another element such that `a * e' = a` and `e' * a = a` for all `a`, then `e = e'`).
*   **C2:** Uniqueness of Annihilator
    *   If an annihilator element `z` exists (as defined in A4), then it is unique. (Meaning, if `z'` is another element such that `a * z' = z'` and `z' * a = z'` for all `a`, then `z = z'`).
*   **C3:** Identity is Idempotent
    *   If an identity element `e` exists (A3), then `e * e = e`.
*   **C4:** Annihilator is Idempotent
    *   If an annihilator element `z` exists (A4), then `z * z = z`.
*   **C5:** A specific rearrangement property
    *   For all `a, b, c` in `S`, the following holds: `(a * b) * c = a * (c * b)`.
*   **C6:** Idempotence of products
    *   For all `a, b` in `S`, the following holds: `(a * b) * (a * b) = a * b`.

## 2. Explanation of Correct Answers

This section details why each potential consequence (C1-C6) is or is not derivable from the predefined assumption sets (Set 1 and Set 2), and identifies the minimal required assumptions for the derivable ones.

**Analysis for Set 1: `{A1, A3}` (Associativity, Identity)**

*   **C1: Uniqueness of Identity:** **Derivable**.
    *   *Reasoning:* The proof relies solely on the properties of the identity element defined in A3. Assume `e` and `e'` are both identity elements. Then `e = e * e'` (because `e'` is an identity) and `e * e' = e'` (because `e` is an identity). Therefore, `e = e'`. Associativity (A1) is not needed.
    *   *Minimal Required Assumptions:* `[""A3""]`
*   **C2: Uniqueness of Annihilator:** **Not Derivable**.
    *   *Reasoning:* This consequence requires the existence of an annihilator element (A4), which is not part of Set 1.
*   **C3: Identity is Idempotent (`e * e = e`):** **Derivable**.
    *   *Reasoning:* Assumption A3 states that `a * e = a` for all `a` in `S`. If we substitute `e` for `a` (since `e` is in `S`), we get `e * e = e`. This only uses A3. Associativity (A1) is not needed.
    *   *Minimal Required Assumptions:* `[""A3""]`
*   **C4: Annihilator is Idempotent (`z * z = z`):** **Not Derivable**.
    *   *Reasoning:* This consequence requires the existence of an annihilator element (A4), which is not part of Set 1.
*   **C5: Rearrangement (`(a * b) * c = a * (c * b)`):** **Not Derivable**.
    *   *Reasoning:* This property requires both Associativity (A1) and Commutativity (A2). While A1 is present in Set 1, A2 is not.
*   **C6: Idempotence of products (`(a * b) * (a * b) = a * b`):** **Not Derivable**.
    *   *Reasoning:* This property is a direct consequence of Idempotence (A5) applied to the element `(a * b)`. A5 is not part of Set 1.

**Analysis for Set 2: `{A1, A2, A4}` (Associativity, Commutativity, Annihilator)**

*   **C1: Uniqueness of Identity:** **Not Derivable**.
    *   *Reasoning:* This consequence requires the existence of an identity element (A3), which is not part of Set 2.
*   **C2: Uniqueness of Annihilator:** **Derivable**.
    *   *Reasoning:* The proof relies solely on the properties of the annihilator element defined in A4. Assume `z` and `z'` are both annihilator elements. Then `z = z' * z` (because `z'` is an annihilator) and `z' * z = z'` (because `z` is an annihilator). Therefore, `z = z'`. Associativity (A1) and Commutativity (A2) are not needed.
    *   *Minimal Required Assumptions:* `[""A4""]`
*   **C3: Identity is Idempotent (`e * e = e`):** **Not Derivable**.
    *   *Reasoning:* This consequence requires the existence of an identity element (A3), which is not part of Set 2.
*   **C4: Annihilator is Idempotent (`z * z = z`):** **Derivable**.
    *   *Reasoning:* Assumption A4 states that `a * z = z` for all `a` in `S`. If we substitute `z` for `a` (since `z` is in `S`), we get `z * z = z`. This only uses A4. Associativity (A1) and Commutativity (A2) are not needed.
    *   *Minimal Required Assumptions:* `[""A4""]`
*   **C5: Rearrangement (`(a * b) * c = a * (c * b)`):** **Derivable**.
    *   *Reasoning:* Start with the left side: `(a * b) * c`. Apply Associativity (A1): `= a * (b * c)`. Apply Commutativity (A2) to the term `(b * c)`: `= a * (c * b)`. Both A1 and A2 are required. A4 is not needed for this specific derivation.
    *   *Minimal Required Assumptions:* `[""A1"", ""A2""]`
*   **C6: Idempotence of products (`(a * b) * (a * b) = a * b`):** **Not Derivable**.
    *   *Reasoning:* This property requires Idempotence (A5), which is not part of Set 2.

## 3. Passing Criteria

This section outlines how to score the candidate's submission and the threshold for passing.

**Scoring Scheme:**

Points are awarded based on the correctness of the submitted `test_submission.json` compared to the `answer_key.json`.

1.  **Correct `assumptions_in_set`:**
    *   Set 1: Correctly listing `[""A1"", ""A3""]` (order doesn't matter): **1 point**
    *   Set 2: Correctly listing `[""A1"", ""A2"", ""A4""]` (order doesn't matter): **1 point**
    *(Note: These are predefined, so candidates should get these points easily if they follow instructions.)*

2.  **Analysis of Consequences (Set 1):** (Total 8 points)
    *   **C1:** Correctly identified as derivable: **1 point**. Correct minimal assumptions `[""A3""]`: **1 point**.
    *   **C2:** Correctly identified as *not* derivable (i.e., not present in `derived_consequences`): **1 point**.
    *   **C3:** Correctly identified as derivable: **1 point**. Correct minimal assumptions `[""A3""]`: **1 point**.
    *   **C4:** Correctly identified as *not* derivable: **1 point**.
    *   **C5:** Correctly identified as *not* derivable: **1 point**.
    *   **C6:** Correctly identified as *not* derivable: **1 point**.

3.  **Analysis of Consequences (Set 2):** (Total 8 points)
    *   **C1:** Correctly identified as *not* derivable: **1 point**.
    *   **C2:** Correctly identified as derivable: **1 point**. Correct minimal assumptions `[""A4""]`: **1 point**.
    *   **C3:** Correctly identified as *not* derivable: **1 point**.
    *   **C4:** Correctly identified as derivable: **1 point**. Correct minimal assumptions `[""A4""]`: **1 point**.
    *   **C5:** Correctly identified as derivable: **1 point**. Correct minimal assumptions `[""A1"", ""A2""]`: **1 point**.
    *   **C6:** Correctly identified as *not* derivable: **1 point**.

**Total Possible Score:** 1 + 1 + 8 + 8 = **18 points**

**Passing Threshold:**

*   A candidate **passes** the Basic Exam if they achieve a score of **14 out of 18 points** (approximately 78%).

**Rationale for Threshold:**

*   This threshold allows for minor errors, such as incorrectly identifying the minimal assumptions for one or two derivable consequences, or misjudging the derivability of one or two consequences.
*   However, it requires the candidate to correctly identify most of the derivable/non-derivable consequences and understand the concept of minimal required assumptions for the majority of cases.
*   Successfully identifying which consequences follow from which set demonstrates the core skill of exploring consequences of assumption sets. Correctly identifying minimal assumptions demonstrates a deeper understanding of logical dependency.
*   Perfect adherence to the JSON format is expected, but minor syntax errors might be manually corrected if the intent is clear, at the evaluator's discretion (though automated checking would fail). Consistent structural errors (e.g., wrong key names) would likely lead to significant point loss.","Okay, here is the Python script `task_evaluation.py` based on the provided evaluation criteria and file structures.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import Libraries:** `json` for handling JSON files, `sys` for command-line arguments and error output, `os` for checking file existence, `collections.defaultdict` isn't strictly needed in the final version but was considered.
2.  **Configuration:** Sets `MAX_SCORE`, the list of `POTENTIAL_CONSEQUENCES`, and the `OUTPUT_FILENAME`.
3.  **`load_json(filepath)`:** Safely loads a JSON file, handling `FileNotFoundError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`. Exits script on error.
4.  **`compare_assumption_lists(list1, list2)`:** Takes two lists, converts them to sets, and checks for equality. This handles cases where the candidate lists assumptions in a different order than the key. Returns `False` if inputs aren't lists.
5.  **`safe_get(data, keys, default=None)`:** A utility to safely access potentially missing nested keys in dictionaries or indices in lists without raising `KeyError` or `IndexError`.
6.  **`evaluate_submission(submission_data, key_data)`:**
    *   Initializes the `results` dictionary to store scores and details.
    *   Creates maps (`key_sets_map`, `submission_sets_map`) from the list of sets in the input data, using `set_id` as the key for easy lookup.
    *   Iterates through the sets defined *in the answer key* (`key_sets_map.items()`) to ensure evaluation covers all required parts.
    *   For each `set_id`:
        *   Finds the corresponding set in the submission data. If not found, records an error for that set and skips detailed evaluation for it, awarding 0 points but still accounting for its maximum possible points.
        *   **Scores `assumptions_in_set`:** Compares the lists using `compare_assumption_lists`. Awards 1 point if they match. (Max 1 point per set).
        *   **Scores `derived_consequences`:**
            *   Creates maps (`key_derived_consequences_map`, `sub_derived_consequences_map`) for the derived consequences within the current set, mapping `consequence_id` to its minimal assumptions. Uses `safe_get` when accessing submission data to handle potentially missing `minimal_required_assumptions`.
            *   Iterates through *all* `POTENTIAL_CONSEQUENCES` (C1-C6).
            *   For each consequence:
                *   Determines if it *should* be derivable (present in `key_derived_consequences_map`).
                *   Determines if it *was submitted* as derivable (present in `sub_derived_consequences_map`).
                *   Awards 1 point if these two match (correctly identified as derivable OR correctly identified as non-derivable).
                *   If the consequence *should* be derivable AND *was submitted* as derivable, it then checks the `minimal_required_assumptions`.
                *   Awards 1 point if the minimal assumption lists match (using `compare_assumption_lists`). Handles cases where the submitted minimal assumptions might be missing or not a list.
            *   Stores detailed results for each consequence.
        *   Calculates and stores the total points achieved and maximum possible points for the set.
    *   Calculates the final `total_points_achieved` and the `overall_score` percentage.
    *   Includes a check to compare the dynamically calculated maximum score against the configured `MAX_SCORE` and issues a warning if they don't match. Uses the calculated score for the percentage if there's a mismatch, as it might reflect the actual structure of the key more accurately.
    *   Returns the complete `results` dictionary.
7.  **`if __name__ == ""__main__"":` block:**
    *   Checks for the correct number of command-line arguments.
    *   Gets the filepaths from `sys.argv`.
    *   Calls `load_json` to read the submission and key files.
    *   Calls `evaluate_submission` to perform the scoring.
    *   Saves the returned `results` dictionary to `test_results.json` using `json.dump` with indentation for readability.
    *   Includes basic print statements for user feedback during execution.

    - The candidate should be able to complete the exam in maximum 90 minutes.
    ","Okay, here is the design for the **Basic Level Practical Exam** focusing on IT Project Manager Risk Assessment and Response Strategy Development capabilities.

**Exam Title:** IT Project Manager Practical Exam: Basic Risk Assessment & Response

**Purpose for Evaluator:**

This exam assesses a candidate's fundamental ability to perform a practical risk assessment for a given IT project scenario and develop initial response strategies for key risks. It focuses on the core process: identifying risks from project documentation, performing qualitative analysis (likelihood/impact), prioritizing based on that analysis, and formulating appropriate basic response actions. The exam simulates a real-world task using standard office tools and requires the candidate to structure their findings in a machine-readable format (JSON) for ease of evaluation. It tests *application* of knowledge, not just recall.

**Exam Structure for Evaluator:**

1.  **Scenario Presentation:** The candidate receives a concise IT project scenario (e.g., implementing a standard off-the-shelf software, a small website migration) presented in a PDF document. This document includes:
    *   Project Goal & Objectives
    *   High-Level Scope Summary
    *   Key Stakeholders (Roles, e.g., Sponsor, Technical Lead, End-User Rep)
    *   High-Level Timeline & Budget Constraints
    *   Known Assumptions & Constraints
    *   (Optional: Short snippets of stakeholder concerns or known issues)
2.  **Task Instructions:** Clear instructions (provided as text or PDF) guide the candidate through the required steps:
    *   Read the project scenario carefully.
    *   Identify potential risks based *only* on the provided materials.
    *   Analyze each identified risk using a provided qualitative scale (e.g., Likelihood: Low/Medium/High; Impact: Low/Medium/High).
    *   Calculate a simple Risk Score (guidance provided, e.g., mapping L/M/H to 1/2/3 and multiplying L * I).
    *   Categorize each risk (e.g., Technical, Resource, Schedule, Budget, External).
    *   Develop a specific response strategy (Avoid, Mitigate, Transfer, Accept) and a brief action description for the **Top 3** highest-scoring risks.
    *   Assign a potential owner (by role) for the response strategy for those Top 3 risks.
    *   Structure the entire output into the specified JSON format.
3.  **Tools & Materials Provided:**
    *   `Project_Scenario.pdf`: The case study document.
    *   `Instructions_and_Scales.pdf`: Detailed instructions, Likelihood/Impact scales definition (e.g., Low=1, Medium=2, High=3), Risk Score calculation method, Risk Categories list, and the required JSON structure definition with field explanations.
4.  **Candidate Task Execution:** The candidate uses the provided materials and standard tools:
    *   **PDF Viewer:** To read the scenario and instructions.
    *   **Spreadsheet (Optional but Recommended):** To list risks, perform analysis (assign L/I, calculate score), sort/prioritize, and draft response strategies before structuring the final JSON.
    *   **Text Editor:** To construct the final `test_submission.json` file according to the specified format.
5.  **Submission:** The candidate submits a single file named `test_submission.json`.
6.  **Time Limit:** 90 minutes.

**JSON Output Structure (`test_submission.json`):**

      ""potential_owner_role"": ""Project Manager""
    }
    // ... potentially more risks identified but without response strategies if not Top 3
  ]
}
```

**Key Practical Elements Tested:**

*   **Information Synthesis:** Can the candidate extract potential problems (risks) from standard project documentation?
*   **Analytical Thinking:** Can the candidate apply simple qualitative measures (Likelihood, Impact) logically to the identified risks based on the scenario context?
*   **Prioritization:** Can the candidate use the analysis results (Risk Score) to determine which risks require immediate attention?
*   **Problem Solving (Basic):** Can the candidate formulate relevant and actionable response strategies for the most critical risks?
*   **Structured Communication:** Can the candidate organize and present their findings clearly in a predefined format (JSON)?
*   **Tool Proficiency (Basic):** Can the candidate effectively use common office tools (PDF reader, spreadsheet for thinking/calculation, text editor for final output) to complete the task?

This design provides a robust way to assess the candidate's practical ability to perform the foundational steps of risk management within a realistic time constraint and using commonly available tools, suitable for remote execution and structured evaluation.","Okay, here are the clear and concise instructions for the candidate for the Basic Level Practical Exam.

**Welcome!**

This practical exam assesses your ability to perform fundamental risk assessment tasks for an IT project scenario using standard tools.

**Your Objective:**

Your goal is to analyze a provided IT project scenario, identify potential risks, perform a qualitative risk analysis, prioritize the risks, and propose basic response strategies for the most critical ones. You will structure your findings in a specific JSON format for submission.

**Provided Materials:**

You will be provided with the following digital files:

1.  **`Project_Scenario.pdf`**: This document contains the details of the IT project you need to analyze, including its goals, scope, stakeholders, timeline, budget constraints, assumptions, and potentially some known issues or concerns.
2.  **`Instructions_and_Scales.pdf`**: This document contains:
    *   Detailed definitions for the Likelihood scale (Low, Medium, High) and their corresponding numerical values (1, 2, 3).
    *   Detailed definitions for the Impact scale (Low, Medium, High) and their corresponding numerical values (1, 2, 3).
    *   The specific formula to calculate the `risk_score` (Likelihood value * Impact value).
    *   A pre-defined list of `category` values you *must* use for classifying risks (e.g., Technical, Resource, Schedule, Budget, Scope, External).
    *   A pre-defined list of `response_strategy_type` values you *must* use (Avoid, Mitigate, Transfer, Accept).
    *   The exact required structure and field descriptions for the `test_submission.json` file.

**Tools Required:**

*   A PDF Viewer (to read the provided materials)
*   A Spreadsheet application (recommended for organizing your work, optional)
*   A Text Editor (to create the final `test_submission.json` file)

**Time Limit:**

You have a maximum of **90 minutes** to complete this exam and prepare your submission file.

**Tasks to Perform:**

1.  **Read and Understand:** Carefully read the `Project_Scenario.pdf` document to understand the project context.
2.  **Identify Risks:** Based *only* on the information presented in `Project_Scenario.pdf`, identify potential risks that could affect the project's success.
3.  **Analyze and Record Risks:** For *each* risk you identify, perform the following analysis and record the details (using a spreadsheet first is recommended):
    *   Assign a unique sequential `risk_id` (number), starting from 1.
    *   Write a clear and concise `description` of the risk.
    *   Assign the most appropriate `category` using *only* the categories listed in `Instructions_and_Scales.pdf`.
    *   Assess the `likelihood` as Low, Medium, or High, using the definitions provided in `Instructions_and_Scales.pdf`.
    *   Assess the `impact` as Low, Medium, or High, using the definitions provided in `Instructions_and_Scales.pdf`.
    *   Calculate the `risk_score` using the specific formula provided in `Instructions_and_Scales.pdf`.
4.  **Prioritize:** Identify the **Top 3** risks based on the calculated `risk_score` (highest scores). If there is a tie for the third position, include all risks with that tied score.
5.  **Develop Response Strategies (Top 3 Only):** For *only* the Top 3 identified risks (including any ties as per step 4):
    *   Determine the most appropriate `response_strategy_type` using *only* the types listed in `Instructions_and_Scales.pdf` (Avoid, Mitigate, Transfer, Accept).
    *   Write a brief `response_strategy_description` outlining the primary action(s) required for the chosen strategy. Keep this description concise (1-2 short sentences or bullet points).
    *   Identify the most logical `potential_owner_role` for overseeing the response strategy, selecting from the stakeholder roles mentioned in the `Project_Scenario.pdf` or standard roles like 'Project Manager'.
6.  **Format Output:** Structure all your findings (including risks *without* response strategies if they are not in the Top 3) into a single JSON file according to the exact structure specified in `Instructions_and_Scales.pdf`.
    *   For risks *not* in the Top 3, the fields `response_strategy_type`, `response_strategy_description`, and `potential_owner_role` should have a value of `null`.

**Submission Format:**

*   You must submit a single file named **`test_submission.json`**.
*   Fill in the `exam_candidate_id` field within the JSON file with the unique ID provided to you.
*   Ensure the file is valid JSON and strictly adheres to the structure defined in `Instructions_and_Scales.pdf`. Failure to match the structure may result in evaluation errors.

**Important Notes:**

*   Base your risk identification and assessment *solely* on the information provided in `Project_Scenario.pdf`. Do not make assumptions beyond the provided text.
*   You *must* use the exact Likelihood/Impact scales, Risk Score calculation formula, Risk Categories, and Response Strategy Types provided in `Instructions_and_Scales.pdf`.
*   Focus on accurately applying the risk assessment process and structuring the output correctly.

Good luck!","Okay, here are the materials required for the Basic Level Practical Exam.

**IT Project Manager Practical Exam: Basic Risk Assessment & Response - Instructions & Scales**

**1. Exam Overview**

Follow the tasks outlined in the main exam instructions document. Use the scales, categories, formulas, and JSON structure defined below.

**2. Risk Identification**

Identify potential risks based *only* on the information provided in `Project_Scenario.pdf`.

**3. Risk Analysis Scales & Calculation**

*   **Likelihood Scale:**
    *   **High (3):** Very likely to occur based on the scenario details (e.g., explicitly stated constraints or high uncertainty).
    *   **Medium (2):** Could occur; contributing factors are present but not guaranteed (e.g., dependencies, potential conflicts).
    *   **Low (1):** Unlikely to occur, but still possible within the project context.

*   **Impact Scale:** (Consider impact on project objectives: scope, schedule, budget, quality)
    *   **High (3):** Could cause major disruption. May lead to project failure, significant delay (>2 weeks), budget overrun (>15%), or inability to meet core objectives.
    *   **Medium (2):** Could cause noticeable disruption. May lead to missed milestones (delay <2 weeks), budget overrun (<15%), or reduced quality/scope.
    *   **Low (1):** Could cause minor inconvenience. Minimal impact on schedule, budget, or scope; potentially requiring minor workarounds.

*   **Risk Score Calculation:**
    *   `risk_score` = Likelihood Value * Impact Value
    *   Example: Likelihood = Medium (2), Impact = High (3) => `risk_score` = 2 * 3 = 6

**4. Risk Categories**

Use *only* one of the following categories for each risk:

*   `Technical`: Risks related to technology, application stability, infrastructure, data connectivity, performance.
*   `Resource`: Risks related to personnel availability, skills, stakeholder engagement.
*   `Schedule`: Risks related to timelines, dependencies, delays, estimations.
*   `Budget`: Risks related to funding, cost overruns, resource costs.
*   `Scope`: Risks related to scope creep, unclear requirements, scope definition.
*   `External`: Risks related to dependencies on external factors or teams not directly part of the core project team (e.g., other internal departments like IT Dev, DBA team in this context).

**5. Response Strategy Types**

For the Top 3 risks (highest `risk_score`), choose *only* one of the following strategy types:

*   `Avoid`: Change the project plan to eliminate the risk or its impact.
*   `Mitigate`: Take action to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk.
*   `Transfer`: Shift the risk or its impact to a third party (less common in this scenario, but possible).
*   `Accept`: Acknowledge the risk and take no action unless it occurs (suitable for low-priority risks or when the response cost outweighs the risk).

**6. JSON Output Structure (`test_submission.json`)**

Create a single JSON file named `test_submission.json` with the following structure. Ensure all field names and value types match exactly. Use `null` for response fields if the risk is not in the Top 3.

```json
{
  ""exam_candidate_id"": ""YOUR_UNIQUE_ID_HERE"", // Replace with the ID provided to you
  ""exam_level"": ""Basic"",
  ""risk_register"": [
    {
      ""risk_id"": 1, // Sequential number assigned by you
      ""description"": ""String: Clear description of the risk."",
      ""category"": ""String: One of [Technical, Resource, Schedule, Budget, Scope, External]"",
      ""likelihood"": ""String: One of [Low, Medium, High]"",
      ""impact"": ""String: One of [Low, Medium, High]"",
      ""risk_score"": ""Number: Calculated Likelihood value * Impact value"",
      ""response_strategy_type"": ""String: One of [Avoid, Mitigate, Transfer, Accept] or null"",
      ""response_strategy_description"": ""String: Brief description of response action(s) or null."",
      ""potential_owner_role"": ""String: Stakeholder role from scenario (e.g., Technical Lead, Project Sponsor, DBA) or 'Project Manager', or null.""
    },
    {
      ""risk_id"": 2,
      // ... other fields ...
      ""response_strategy_type"": null, // Example for non-Top 3 risk
      ""response_strategy_description"": null,
      ""potential_owner_role"": null
    }
    // ... Add more risk objects as identified
  ]
}

```

**7. Submission**

Ensure your final `test_submission.json` file is valid JSON and adheres strictly to the structure above. Submit only this file.

</MATERIALS_FOR_CANDIDATE>

<MATERIALS_EXPLANATION_FOR_EVALUATOR>

**1. How Materials Were Created:**

*   **Scenario (`Project_Scenario.pdf`):** A deliberately simple, common IT project (internal tool deployment) was chosen to be relatable and manageable within the time limit. Specific constraints and potential issues were embedded directly into the text to serve as clear triggers for risk identification. The scope is tightly defined to limit ambiguity. Stakeholder roles are explicitly listed to provide options for the `potential_owner_role`.
*   **Instructions & Scales (`Instructions_and_Scales.pdf`):** These provide rigid structure to simplify evaluation.
    *   The Likelihood/Impact scales are qualitative (L/M/H) but mapped to numbers (1/2/3) for a simple, objective `risk_score` calculation (L\*I). This tests basic analysis and prioritization.
    *   Pre-defined Risk Categories and Response Strategy Types force the candidate to use a standard taxonomy, preventing subjective classifications and making automated checks easier.
    *   The JSON structure is precisely defined to ensure consistent, machine-readable output.

**2. Intended Risks and Expected Analysis (Examples - Candidate might identify others or analyze slightly differently, but these are the most obvious):**

*   **Risk 1:** Technical Lead (John Smith) has limited availability (50%).
    *   *Description:* Delay in server provisioning or issue resolution due to Technical Lead's limited availability (50% allocation).
    *   *Category:* Resource
    *   *Likelihood:* High (explicitly stated constraint) -> 3
    *   *Impact:* Medium (could delay tasks, but maybe not derail the whole project if managed) -> 2
    *   *Risk Score:* 6
    *   *Potential Response (Mitigate):* Clarify priorities with John Smith and his manager; identify specific tasks needing his input early; explore if any tasks can be delegated.
    *   *Potential Owner:* Project Manager / Technical Lead
*   **Risk 2:** DBA team backlog may delay database access setup.
    *   *Description:* Delay in obtaining necessary database connectivity due to DBA team backlog.
    *   *Category:* External (Dependency on another team) or Schedule
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium (stated backlog, but not guaranteed impact) -> 2
    *   *Impact:* Medium (could delay configuration and testing) -> 2
    *   *Risk Score:* 4
    *   *Potential Response (Mitigate):* Submit DBA request immediately; follow up regularly; escalate to Sponsor if delays occur.
    *   *Potential Owner:* Project Manager / DBA
*   **Risk 3:** Fixed budget offers no contingency for unexpected issues.
    *   *Description:* Project cost exceeds the fixed $5,000 budget due to unforeseen technical issues or resource time.
    *   *Category:* Budget
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium (fixed budgets are inherently risky, potential for issues exists) -> 2
    *   *Impact:* High (no flexibility means potential project halt or scope reduction) -> 3
    *   *Risk Score:* 6
    *   *Potential Response (Mitigate):* Track expenses closely; identify potential cost-saving measures early; keep Sponsor informed of budget status. (Could also be Accept if analysis deems risk low enough, but Mitigate is more proactive).
    *   *Potential Owner:* Project Manager / Project Sponsor
*   **Risk 4:** Limited support available from the original ""EmpDir"" application developers.
    *   *Description:* Inability to resolve application-specific bugs or issues quickly due to limited availability of the original development team.
    *   *Category:* Technical or External
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium (minimal documentation mentioned, team reassigned) -> 2
    *   *Impact:* Medium (could delay deployment if bugs are found) -> 2
    *   *Risk Score:* 4
    *   *Potential Response (Mitigate):* Allocate extra time for testing; request any available documentation/contact point from Dev team upfront.
    *   *Potential Owner:* Technical Lead / Project Manager
*   **Risk 5:** Assumption that the ""EmpDir"" application is bug-free might be incorrect.
    *   *Description:* The provided ""EmpDir"" application contains significant bugs requiring fixes, delaying deployment.
    *   *Category:* Technical
    *   *Likelihood:* Low/Medium (stated as assumption, but minimal docs/support increases risk) -> 1 or 2
    *   *Impact:* High (if major bugs, could halt deployment or require unplanned dev work) -> 3
    *   *Risk Score:* 3 or 6 (depends on Likelihood assessment)
    *   *Potential Response (Mitigate):* Thorough testing early in the process; contingency planning for bug fixing time/resources (though budget is fixed).
    *   *Potential Owner:* Technical Lead

**3. Prioritization & Top 3:**

Based on the example scores above, the Top 3 risks would likely be:
1.  Technical Lead Availability (Score 6)
2.  Fixed Budget Constraint (Score 6)
3.  Potential Application Bugs (Score 6, if assessed as M/H) OR DBA Backlog / Limited Dev Support (Score 4, if bugs assessed L/H=3).

The candidate needs to select the top 3 based on *their* calculated scores and provide responses only for those. Ties should be included.

**4. Tricky Elements & Common Pitfalls:**

*   **Distinguishing Assumptions vs. Risks:** Candidates might list an assumption (e.g., ""DB is accurate"") as a risk itself, rather than the risk stemming *from* the assumption being wrong (e.g., ""Inaccurate data in DB leads to user dissatisfaction""). The latter is the actual risk.
*   **Overlooking Constraints:** Failing to identify risks directly linked to stated constraints (budget, resource availability).
*   **Vague Descriptions:** Writing risk descriptions that are too generic (e.g., ""Project delay"") instead of specific causes (""Delay *due to* resource availability"").
*   **Incorrect Categorization:** Using categories not on the provided list or misclassifying risks (e.g., calling DBA dependency 'Resource' instead of 'External' or 'Schedule').
*   **Inappropriate Response Strategy:** Choosing 'Avoid' when it's not feasible, or 'Accept' for a high-impact/high-likelihood risk without justification. Response descriptions might be too vague.
*   **JSON Formatting Errors:** Incorrect field names, data types (e.g., string instead of number for `risk_score`), missing commas, or incorrect nesting will break the structure.
*   **Analyzing Risks Not Based *Solely* on Provided Text:** Bringing in outside knowledge or assumptions not supported by the scenario.

**5. ""Hidden"" Information:**

*   The limited availability of the *original developers* combined with *minimal documentation* strongly implies a higher risk associated with the assumption that the application is bug-free or easily deployable.
*   The Technical Lead working on *another critical project* emphasizes the severity of their 50% allocation.
*   The DBA team being *backlogged* is a direct pointer to a potential schedule dependency risk.

**6. Evaluation Simplification:**

*   The pre-defined scales, categories, response types, and JSON structure make evaluation significantly easier and more objective.
*   The simple L\*I score provides a clear (though basic) prioritization mechanism to check.
*   The focus is on applying the *process* correctly within the given constraints, rather than deep domain expertise.

**2. Explanation of Correct Answers and Derivations**

This section explains the reasoning behind the risks identified in the `evaluator_key.json`.

*   **General Approach:** Risks were identified by reviewing the scenario for explicit constraints, assumptions, dependencies, and resource limitations mentioned in sections 3, 4, 5, and 6. The analysis (L/I/Score) uses the provided scales (L=1, M=2, H=3) and formula (L\*I). Categories and Response Types strictly adhere to the provided lists.

*   **Risk 1: Technical Lead Availability**
    *   *Source:* Section 3 & 5 explicitly state John Smith is the Technical Lead, responsible for key tasks, but only allocated 50% and working on another critical project.
    *   *Category:* `Resource` (Personnel availability).
    *   *Likelihood:* `High` (3) - Explicitly stated constraint.
    *   *Impact:* `Medium` (2) - Could significantly delay tasks on a short 6-week project, but might not cause total failure if managed.
    *   *Score:* 3 * 2 = 6.
    *   *Response (Mitigate):* Action needed to reduce impact/likelihood. Proactive planning and communication are key. Owner: PM coordinates resources.

*   **Risk 2: Fixed Budget Constraint**
    *   *Source:* Section 4 & 5 state budget is $5k, fixed, with no flexibility.
    *   *Category:* `Budget` (Funding constraint).
    *   *Likelihood:* `Medium` (2) - While the budget is fixed, the *likelihood* of an *overrun* depends on unforeseen issues, which are reasonably possible in any IT project.
    *   *Impact:* `High` (3) - ""No flexibility"" means any overrun could halt the project or force scope cuts.
    *   *Score:* 2 * 3 = 6.
    *   *Response (Mitigate):* Action needed to stay within budget. Close monitoring and control are essential. Owner: PM manages budget, Sponsor approves funding.

*   **Risk 3: Application Bugs**
    *   *Source:* Section 5 assumption (""app is bug-free"") combined with Section 6 (""minimal documentation"", ""dev team limited availability""). Challenging an assumption often reveals a risk.
    *   *Category:* `Technical` (Software quality/stability).
    *   *Likelihood:* `Medium` (2) - The lack of docs/support increases the chance the ""bug-free"" assumption is wrong.
    *   *Impact:* `High` (3) - Significant bugs could require unplanned work (impacting fixed budget/schedule) or halt deployment.
    *   *Score:* 2 * 3 = 6.
    *   *Response (Mitigate):* Action to find bugs early or reduce their impact. Testing is the primary mitigation. Owner: Tech Lead executes testing.

*   **Risk 4: Limited Developer Support**
    *   *Source:* Section 6 explicitly states the original dev team has limited availability and documentation is minimal.
    *   *Category:* `External` (Dependency on another team's availability/support) or `Technical`. `External` emphasizes the dependency aspect.
    *   *Likelihood:* `High` (3) - Explicitly stated constraint.
    *   *Impact:* `Medium` (2) - If issues arise that *require* dev support (e.g., complex bugs), resolution will be slow, impacting the schedule.
    *   *Score:* 3 * 2 = 6.
    *   *Response (Mitigate):* Action to reduce reliance or impact of delay. Getting info upfront and planning buffer time helps. Owner: PM coordinates external dependencies.

*   **Risk 5: DBA Team Backlog**
    *   *Source:* Section 3 & 5 state the DBA team is backlogged and has limited bandwidth.
    *   *Category:* `External` (Dependency on another team) or `Schedule`. `External` chosen for consistency.
    *   *Likelihood:* `Medium` (2) - Backlog is stated, increasing the chance of delay, but it's not guaranteed.
    *   *Impact:* `Medium` (2) - Delay could impact configuration and testing phases, potentially pushing the schedule.
    *   *Score:* 2 * 2 = 4.
    *   *Response:* None required (not Top 3/4). `null` fields.

*   **Risk 6: Off-Hours Deployment Coordination**
    *   *Source:* Section 5 constraint (""Deployment must occur outside of core business hours""). This requires coordination.
    *   *Category:* `Schedule` (Relates to timing and coordination).
    *   *Likelihood:* `Low` (1) - Typically manageable, but still a coordination point that could fail.
    *   *Impact:* `Medium` (2) - Failure could delay go-live or cause disruption if done during business hours.
    *   *Score:* 1 * 2 = 2.
    *   *Response:* None required. `null` fields.

*   **Risk 7: End-User Rep Availability/Engagement**
    *   *Source:* Section 3 lists David Lee for acceptance testing/review. Implicit risk that stakeholders may not be available/engaged when needed.
    *   *Category:* `Resource` (Stakeholder engagement).
    *   *Likelihood:* `Low` (1) - No specific indication of issues, but always a possibility.
    *   *Impact:* `Medium` (2) - Could delay testing sign-off or result in missed user requirements/feedback.
    *   *Score:* 1 * 2 = 2.
    *   *Response:* None required. `null` fields.

*   **Prioritization & Top 3 (Tie Handling):** The instructions state to develop responses for the Top 3 highest scores, including ties. In the key, risks 1, 2, 3, and 4 all score 6. Therefore, responses are required for all four. A candidate correctly following instructions should provide responses for all risks tied at the highest score level that falls within the ""Top 3"" concept.

---

**3. Passing Criteria**

This is a basic level exam focusing on applying the fundamental process. A passing candidate should demonstrate competence in the core steps, even if their analysis isn't identical to the key.

**Minimum Requirements for Passing:**

A candidate must demonstrate proficiency in the following areas. Failure to meet the standard in **two or more** areas would generally constitute a fail.

1.  **Risk Identification:**
    *   **Standard:** Identifies at least **4** distinct, plausible risks based *only* on the scenario document.
    *   **Must Include:** At least **2** of the high-priority risks (Score 6 in the key: Tech Lead Availability, Fixed Budget, App Bugs, Dev Support). Missing *all* major constraints/dependencies is a significant failure.
    *   **Acceptable:** Descriptions are clear enough to understand the risk.

2.  **Risk Analysis (L/I/Score):**
    *   **Standard:** Assigns Likelihood and Impact values (Low/Medium/High) that are *reasonable* and justifiable based on the scenario for the majority (>50%) of identified risks. Calculates the `risk_score` correctly based on *their* assigned L/I values for all identified risks.
    *   **Acceptable:** Minor deviations from the key's L/I assessment (e.g., Medium vs. High) are acceptable if the candidate's logic seems sound within the context. Gross misjudgments (e.g., rating 'Fixed Budget' impact as Low) are penalized.

3.  **Prioritization & Response Strategy Application:**
    *   **Standard:** Correctly identifies *their* Top 3 (or more, in case of ties) risks based on *their calculated* `risk_score` values. Provides the required response fields (`response_strategy_type`, `response_strategy_description`, `potential_owner_role`) *only* for these top risks, leaving them `null` for others.
    *   **Acceptable:** The chosen `response_strategy_type` is logical for the risk (e.g., Mitigate for high-impact/high-likelihood risks). The `response_strategy_description` is relevant and suggests a concrete action (even if brief). The `potential_owner_role` is plausible based on the scenario.

4.  **Adherence to Instructions & Formatting:**
    *   **Standard:** Uses the specified Risk Categories and Response Strategy Types *exactly* as provided. Uses the correct stakeholder roles or 'Project Manager' for owners.
    *   **Must Include:** Submits a single file named `test_submission.json`. The file must be **valid JSON** and strictly adhere to the specified structure (correct field names, data types - String/Number/null, array/object structure).
    *   **Acceptable:** Minor typos in free-text `description` or `response_strategy_description` fields are generally acceptable unless they render the meaning unclear. Incorrect data types (e.g., `risk_score` as a string) or invalid JSON structure are significant failures.

**Summary Evaluation:**

*   **Pass:** Meets the standard in at least 3 out of the 4 areas above, including producing valid, correctly structured JSON. Demonstrates a clear understanding of the basic risk management process (Identify, Analyze, Prioritize, Plan Response).
*   **Fail:** Fails to meet the standard in 2 or more areas. Common failure points include: missing major risks, fundamentally flawed analysis, incorrect prioritization logic, failure to follow formatting/instruction constraints (especially invalid JSON).","```python

**Explanation:**

1.  **Configuration:** Sets up constants like L/I mappings, valid categories/responses, required JSON keys, keyword sets for matching key risks, and scoring weights.
2.  **Helper Functions:**
    *   `load_json`: Safely loads JSON files, handling errors like file not found or invalid format.
    *   `validate_string_enum`: Checks if a value is one of the allowed strings for fields like `category`, `likelihood`, `impact`, `response_strategy_type`.
    *   `calculate_expected_score`: Computes the score based on L/I strings.
    *   `match_risks`: Implements the keyword-based matching logic to associate candidate risks with key risks. It returns dictionaries mapping candidate IDs to key IDs and vice-versa. This is crucial for comparing analysis and response details.
    *   `get_key_risk_by_id`: Simple utility to retrieve a key risk object using its ID.
3.  **Evaluation Functions:** Each function corresponds to a major evaluation criterion:
    *   `evaluate_formatting`: Checks JSON validity, presence of required keys, and basic data types (spot-checked on the first risk).
    *   `evaluate_identification`: Checks if the minimum number of risks were identified and if at least two high-priority key risks (defined by a score threshold in the key, e.g., >=6) were covered (based on the matching results).
    *   `evaluate_analysis`: Iterates through candidate risks.
        *   Checks if the `risk_score` is calculated correctly based on the *candidate's* L/I values.
        *   For *matched* risks, compares the candidate's L/I assessment and category against the key, allowing some tolerance for L/I.
        *   Scores are normalized based on the number of risks evaluated/matched.
    *   `evaluate_prioritization_response`:
        *   Determines the candidate's top risks based on *their* scores (handling ties correctly according to the ""Top 3"" rule).
        *   Checks if response fields (`response_strategy_type`, etc.) are correctly populated (non-`null` for top risks, `null` otherwise).
        *   For the candidate's identified top risks, it evaluates the logic of the `response_strategy_type` (comparing to the key for matched risks), the relevance of the description (non-empty check), and the plausibility of the owner role (non-empty check).
        *   Scores are normalized based on the number of top risks evaluated.
4.  **Main Execution (`main` function):**
    *   Uses `argparse` to get the submission and key file paths from the command line.
    *   Loads the JSON data using `load_json`.
    *   Initializes the `results` dictionary.
    *   Calls each evaluation function in sequence.
    *   Aggregates scores and feedback.
    *   Calculates the `overall_score` as a percentage.
    *   Saves the detailed `results` dictionary to `test_results.json`.
    *   Includes error handling for file operations and JSON parsing.

**To Run the Script:**

1.  Save the code as `task_evaluation.py`.
2.  Make sure you have the candidate's submission file (e.g., `test_submission.json`) and the answer key file (you'll need to create this based on the `<evaluation_information>` section, naming it e.g., `answer_key.json`) in the same directory.
3.  Run from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python task_evaluation.py test_submission.json answer_key.json
    ```
4.  A `test_results.json` file will be created in the same directory with the detailed evaluation.","{'exam_candidate_id': 'EVALUATOR_KEY', 'exam_level': 'Basic', 'risk_register': [{'risk_id': 1, 'description': ""Delay in server provisioning or technical task completion due to Technical Lead's limited availability (50% allocation)."", 'category': 'Resource', 'likelihood': 'High', 'impact': 'Medium', 'risk_score': 6, 'response_strategy_type': 'Mitigate', 'response_strategy_description': 'Confirm project task priorities with Tech Lead and their manager; identify critical path tasks requiring Tech Lead input early; explore delegation options.', 'potential_owner_role': 'Project Manager'}, {'risk_id': 2, 'description': 'Project cost exceeds the fixed $5,000 budget due to unforeseen technical issues, scope changes, or resource time.', 'category': 'Budget', 'likelihood': 'Medium', 'impact': 'High', 'risk_score': 6, 'response_strategy_type': 'Mitigate', 'response_strategy_description': 'Implement strict change control; track expenses meticulously against budget; report budget status regularly to Project Sponsor; identify potential cost-saving measures proactively.', 'potential_owner_role': 'Project Manager'}, {'risk_id': 3, 'description': ""The provided 'EmpDir' application contains significant bugs requiring unplanned fixes, delaying deployment."", 'category': 'Technical', 'likelihood': 'Medium', 'impact': 'High', 'risk_score': 6, 'response_strategy_type': 'Mitigate', 'response_strategy_description': 'Allocate sufficient time for thorough testing early in the schedule; ensure Technical Lead performs code review/deployment dry-run if possible; document all bugs found.', 'potential_owner_role': 'Technical Lead'}, {'risk_id': 4, 'description': 'Inability to resolve application-specific bugs or deployment issues quickly due to limited availability and minimal documentation from the original development team.', 'category': 'External', 'likelihood': 'High', 'impact': 'Medium', 'risk_score': 6, 'response_strategy_type': 'Mitigate', 'response_strategy_description': 'Proactively request any available documentation or contact points from the development team lead; allocate contingency time in the schedule for potential troubleshooting.', 'potential_owner_role': 'Project Manager'}, {'risk_id': 5, 'description': ""Delay in obtaining necessary database connectivity or support due to the DBA team's backlog."", 'category': 'External', 'likelihood': 'Medium', 'impact': 'Medium', 'risk_score': 4, 'response_strategy_type': None, 'response_strategy_description': None, 'potential_owner_role': None}, {'risk_id': 6, 'description': 'Deployment activities are delayed or cause disruption because coordination for deployment outside core business hours fails.', 'category': 'Schedule', 'likelihood': 'Low', 'impact': 'Medium', 'risk_score': 2, 'response_strategy_type': None, 'response_strategy_description': None, 'potential_owner_role': None}, {'risk_id': 7, 'description': 'End-user acceptance testing is delayed or ineffective due to lack of engagement or availability of the End-User Representative.', 'category': 'Resource', 'likelihood': 'Low', 'impact': 'Medium', 'risk_score': 2, 'response_strategy_type': None, 'response_strategy_description': None, 'potential_owner_role': None}]}",[],True,True,0.0,99.0,89.0,4.0,True,,"{'overview': prompt_token_count: 237
