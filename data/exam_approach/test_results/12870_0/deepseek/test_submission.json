        "question1": "In the music industry, typical commission rates for agents range from 10% to 20%, with a recent trend towards the lower end due to increased competition. In film, agents typically charge 10% for actors, though some top-tier agents have negotiated higher rates for A-list clients. In professional sports, agents usually take 3% to 5% of an athlete's contract, with some leagues capping fees to protect players.",
        "question2": "Three streaming platforms that have significantly changed their content acquisition strategies include Netflix, which has shifted towards more original content and less reliance on licensed shows; Apple TV+, which has increased its budget for high-profile original series and films; and Disney+, which has focused on leveraging its existing franchises like Marvel and Star Wars. These changes mean artists and performers may have more opportunities for original content deals but could face stricter exclusivity clauses.",
        "question3": "The current standard revenue split in the music industry is typically 15% to 25% for artists, with the remainder going to labels and publishers. This has shifted slightly in favor of artists due to the rise of direct-to-consumer platforms and increased bargaining power from independent artists. However, major labels still dominate the market, often retaining the lion's share of revenue.",
        "question4": "In the NBA, the salary cap for the 2023-2024 season is approximately $136 million, with a luxury tax threshold of $165 million. In the NFL, the salary cap is around $224.8 million for the same period. These caps influence contract negotiations by limiting the total amount teams can spend, often leading to creative structuring of deals, including signing bonuses and performance incentives."

        "question5": "Three major talent agency changes include the merger of CAA and ICM Partners, which created a powerhouse in talent representation; Endeavor's acquisition of a majority stake in WWE, expanding its sports and entertainment portfolio; and UTA's acquisition of Curtis Brown Group, enhancing its international reach. These changes consolidate power among a few large agencies, potentially limiting options for clients and increasing competition for representation.",
        "question6": "Two record-breaking deals include Lionel Messi's contract with Inter Miami CF, which includes equity in the team and revenue-sharing agreements, and Taylor Swift's re-recording of her early albums, which has set a precedent for artists reclaiming control over their masters. These deals are noteworthy for their innovative structures and potential to influence future negotiations.",
        "question7": "A recent high-profile licensing deal is LeBron James' partnership with PepsiCo for his Lobos 1707 tequila brand. This deal is notable for its focus on a celebrity-owned brand rather than traditional endorsements, highlighting a shift towards equity-based partnerships in the beverage industry.",
        "question8": "A recent trend in deal structuring is the inclusion of equity stakes for performers. For example, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson secured an equity stake in the XFL as part of his deal to promote the league. This trend reflects a growing preference for long-term investment over upfront payments."

        "question9": "Three emerging digital platforms include Patreon, where creators monetize exclusive content through subscriber memberships; TikTok, which has introduced tipping and live-streaming revenue options; and OnlyFans, which allows creators to earn directly from fans through subscriptions and pay-per-view content. These platforms typically take a percentage of earnings, ranging from 10% to 20%.",
        "question10": "NFTs are being utilized by performers and athletes to offer exclusive content and experiences. For example, Kings of Leon released their album as an NFT, offering unique perks to buyers, and NBA Top Shot allows fans to purchase and trade officially licensed basketball highlights as NFTs. These examples demonstrate the potential for NFTs to create new revenue streams and fan engagement opportunities.",
        "question11": "New performance formats include virtual concerts and metaverse events, which have gained popularity due to the pandemic. These events are typically monetized through ticket sales, virtual merchandise, and sponsorships. For example, Travis Scott's virtual concert in Fortnite attracted millions of viewers and generated significant revenue through in-game purchases.",
        "question12": "A recent innovation in merchandise is the rise of limited-edition drops and collaborations with high-end fashion brands. For example, Rihanna's Fenty brand partnered with luxury retailer LVMH to create exclusive collections. This approach leverages scarcity and brand prestige to drive sales and create buzz."

        "question13": "Two recent regulatory changes include the California Talent Agencies Act amendments, which clarify the roles of agents and managers, and the EU's Digital Services Act, which imposes stricter rules on online platforms. These changes could impact how agents operate by increasing compliance requirements and potentially limiting certain business practices.",
        "question14": "Standard contract terms for streaming content have shifted towards shorter exclusivity periods and more flexible licensing agreements. This change is driven by the need for platforms to quickly adapt to changing viewer preferences and the increasing competition among streaming services.",
        "question15": "A recent development in intellectual property protection is the introduction of the CASE Act in the U.S., which establishes a small claims court for copyright disputes. This makes it easier for performers and athletes to protect and monetize their creative works without costly litigation.",
        "question16": "Recent changes in union agreements include SAG-AFTRA's new contracts, which address streaming residuals and improved working conditions. These changes are important for agents to consider when negotiating deals, as they may affect compensation structures and working terms for clients."
