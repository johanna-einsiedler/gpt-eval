                "Accident occurred at 3:15 AM on a Sunday, which is an unusual time and may suggest factors beyond just hitting a deer, such as fatigue or impaired driving.",
                "Police report mentions a faint odor of alcohol on the driver's breath, yet no field sobriety test was administered, raising questions about why further investigation into potential impairment was not conducted.",
                "There is a discrepancy between the claimant's statement of swerving to avoid a deer and the police report which makes no mention of a deer, suggesting inconsistency in the account of events.",
                "The claimant is self-employed and claiming lost wages without providing any documentation to substantiate the income loss, making it difficult to verify the legitimacy of this part of the claim."
            ],
            "justification_for_referral": "The combination of the early morning accident, the officer's observation of alcohol odor without further investigation, the inconsistency in the accident narrative (deer vs. no deer in police report), and the unsubstantiated lost wage claim raises concerns about the accuracy and potential misrepresentation of the claim details. These red flags suggest a need for further scrutiny to determine the true circumstances of the accident and the validity of the claimed losses.",

                "Minimal signs of forced entry, with only a back window found slightly ajar, which is unusual for a burglary and could indicate the window was left unsecured or opened from the inside.",
                "The claimant increased jewelry coverage significantly (from $2,000 to $7,000) just two months prior to the reported loss, which is a common indicator of potential premeditated fraudulent claims involving high-value items.",
                "The claimant's social media post from Saturday night at a local casino contradicts her statement of being out of town for the weekend, directly undermining her alibi and raising suspicion about her whereabouts during the alleged burglary.",
                "The claim includes $1,000 in cash with no receipt or proof of ownership, which is difficult to verify and is often exploited in fraudulent property claims."
            ],
            "justification_for_referral": "The lack of clear forced entry, the recent increase in jewelry coverage, the claimant's contradictory social media activity placing her locally during the alleged absence, and the undocumented cash claim collectively present strong indicators of a potentially fraudulent claim. These red flags warrant a thorough investigation to verify the occurrence of a genuine burglary and the legitimacy of the claimed losses.",
