            "description": "The specification uses vague and subjective language, such as 'Durable material' for the stapler's material. This lacks quantifiable criteria.",
            "impact": "This vagueness allows suppliers to interpret 'durable' subjectively, potentially leading to the procurement of staplers made from low-quality materials that are not sufficiently robust for office use, resulting in frequent breakdowns and increased replacement costs."

            "weakness_number": 2,
            "description": "The 'Capacity' is defined as 'Standard office stapling capacity,' which is not measurable and open to interpretation. It does not specify the number of sheets the stapler should be able to staple.",
            "impact": "Without a defined sheet capacity, suppliers may provide staplers with insufficient stapling capability for typical office tasks. This could lead to user frustration, inefficient workflow, and the need to purchase additional, more capable staplers, increasing overall costs."

            "weakness_number": 3,
            "description": "The 'Packaging' is specified as 'Bulk packaging,' which is insufficiently detailed. It does not specify the quantity per package or the type of packaging material.",
            "impact": "The lack of detail regarding packaging could result in staplers being delivered in inadequate packaging, leading to damage during shipping and handling. Furthermore, 'bulk packaging' is ambiguous and could mean large, unwieldy packages that are difficult to manage and distribute within the office, potentially increasing handling time and risk of loss or damage."
