            "description": "The 'Capacity' specification is vague, stating only 'Standard office stapling capacity'.",
            "impact": "This is subjective and open to interpretation by suppliers.  'Standard' is not defined, leading to potential inconsistencies in the stapling capacity offered. We might receive staplers that cannot handle the typical document thickness in our office, leading to user frustration and ineffective stapling."

            "weakness_number": 2,
            "description": "The 'Material' specification is too generic, stating 'Durable material'.",
            "impact": " 'Durable' is subjective and doesn't guarantee quality. Suppliers might use low-grade or brittle materials to reduce costs, resulting in staplers that are prone to breakage, have a short lifespan, or feel flimsy. This could increase replacement costs and negatively impact user experience."
        },
        {
            "weakness_number": 3,
            "description": "The specification lacks any mention of staple type compatibility.",
            "impact": "Without specifying the staple type, we risk procuring staplers that are incompatible with our existing staple inventory or require less common, potentially more expensive, or harder-to-source staples. This can lead to operational inefficiencies and increased supply costs."
        },
        {
            "weakness_number": 4,
            "description": "The 'Color' specification 'Black or Grey' is broad and offers limited control over aesthetics.",
            "impact": "While functional, allowing 'Black or Grey' gives us less control over office aesthetics and standardization.  If office branding or a consistent look is desired, this vague color specification is insufficient. It might lead to a mix of black and grey staplers, which may not be ideal for a uniform office environment."
