Justifications are weighted at 40% and amounts at 60% of the score for each reserve type (Property Damage, Bodily Injury, Claim Expenses). The 'total_recommended_reserve' is evaluated based on the correctness of the sum of the individual amounts.  A minimum of 3 correctly answered components (amount and justification pair considered as one component) is also required for passing, even if the overall score is above 75%."

For justification texts, a close match is expected, focusing on the presence of key information and references to the correct documents and policy sections.  Automated validation can be performed by comparing the submitted JSON with the answer key JSON.  For a more lenient evaluation of justifications, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques could be employed to assess the semantic similarity between the submitted and expected justifications, but for this basic exam, keyword matching or manual review of justifications is sufficient. For automated scoring, exact string matching for justifications and numerical equality for amounts is recommended for simplicity."
