Focus is on 'how the fire started' to understand the sequence of events and potential causes.  Other valid questions could focus on what was being cooked, if anything was left unattended, etc."

        "section2_investigation_planning": {
            "witness_statement_new_info": "The witness statement confirms the smoke alarm, smoke, and claimant's statement about a small kitchen fire she extinguished. It adds corroboration and timeline (around lunchtime). It does not contradict the claim report but adds context.",
            "damage_observed_photos": "Based on the descriptions in `Photos_Damage_zip_content_description`.  Answers should reflect understanding of fire damage (charring, destruction) and smoke/soot damage. Specific examples from the descriptions are expected.",
            "information_needed_investigation": "These are standard next steps in a property claim investigation. Recorded statement is crucial for claimant's detailed account. Photos/video provide visual evidence of the full extent of damage. Estimates are needed to quantify the loss for settlement. Other valid answers could include policy documents (full version), inspection reports, contents inventory.",

            "potential_policy_exclusion": "Based on 'Exclusions - Section I and Section II' in `PolicyDocument_Sections.pdf`, 'Intentional Loss' is a relevant exclusion. If the fire was intentionally set by the insured, coverage could be excluded.  While there's no indication of this yet, it's a standard exclusion to consider in fire claims. Other less directly relevant exclusions could be argued, but 'Intentional Loss' is the most pertinent at this stage.  'No immediate exclusion identified' is also acceptable if the candidate focuses only on the initial information and finds no immediate red flags for exclusions.",
            "furniture_damage_coverage": "Based on 'Coverage C - Personal Property' in `PolicyDocument_Sections.pdf`, personal property owned or used by the insured is covered. Furniture inside the house falls under personal property, not dwelling or other structures."

Professional and empathetic tone is important.  Conciseness (under 100 words) is also a requirement.  The example provided is a good template, but variations in wording are acceptable as long as core elements are present and tone is appropriate."

Property inspection is essential to assess damages. Reviewing the full policy is crucial for coverage confirmation. Other valid steps could include setting up claim file, sending reservation of rights letter (if exclusions are a concern), etc.",
            "service_orientation_importance": "Focus should be on claimant experience and service.  Communication, empathy, and timeliness are key aspects of good service in claims handling.

For questions with multiple parts (e.g., list three items), each correct item contributes proportionally to the point (e.g., if 3 items are asked, each correct item is worth 1/3 of a point, totaling 1 point for all three correct).

Evaluators should assess if the candidate's answer demonstrates understanding of the task, uses information from provided materials appropriately, and is logically sound. For email drafts (4.2), assess for professionalism, empathy, and inclusion of required elements. For open-ended questions, assess for relevance, clarity, and thoughtfulness.  Keywords or concepts from the 'answer_explanations' can be used as guidelines for evaluation.",
