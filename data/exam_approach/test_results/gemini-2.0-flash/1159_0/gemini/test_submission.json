    "answer_q1": "A standardized procedure is important for GreenTech Solutions because it addresses the current issues of inconsistent spending, potential duplication of purchases, and difficulty in tracking equipment inventory. By implementing a clear process, GreenTech Solutions can gain better control over its office equipment procurement, ensure cost-effectiveness, and improve asset management.",
    "answer_q2": "Key pieces of information that a department should include when submitting a request for office equipment are: Department Name, Requester Name and Contact Information, Date of Request, Detailed Description of Equipment Required (including specifications if necessary), Quantity Required, Justification for the Need, and Estimated Budget (if known).",
    "answer_q3": "One potential challenge is resistance to change from departments that are accustomed to making independent purchasing decisions. Departments might perceive the new procedure as bureaucratic and time-consuming. To mitigate this, GreenTech Solutions should clearly communicate the benefits of the standardized procedure, such as cost savings and better resource management.  Providing training on the new procedure and offering ongoing support to departments during the initial implementation phase will also be crucial to ensure smooth adoption."
