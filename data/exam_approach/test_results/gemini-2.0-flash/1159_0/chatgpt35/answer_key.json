        "answer_q3": "Potential challenge: Resistance to change from departments used to independent purchasing. Mitigation: Communicate benefits of the new procedure, provide training, and offer support during the initial implementation phase."

    "explanation_of_answers": {
        "procedure_document": "The procedure document should outline a logical flow for office equipment procurement, starting from need identification to equipment receipt and recording.  Key elements expected are:\n\n*   **Clear Steps:**  The procedure should be broken down into numbered or clearly defined steps.\n*   **Roles and Responsibilities:**  It should explicitly mention the roles of the Department Head and Procurement Officer and their respective responsibilities at each stage.\n*   **Request Initiation:**  A formal request process (e.g., using an 'Equipment Request Form' - even if just mentioned conceptually) is crucial.\n*   **Approval Process:**  Department Head approval before proceeding to procurement is essential.\n*   **Procurement Process:**  Mentioning obtaining quotes, issuing purchase orders, and receiving equipment are key procurement steps.\n*   **Record Keeping:**  The procedure should include a step for recording the equipment in an inventory or asset register.\n*   **Practicality and Clarity:** The language should be simple and easy for employees to understand and follow.\n\nWhile the exact wording and formatting can vary, the presence of these core elements and a logical flow are crucial for a satisfactory procedure document.",
        "answer_q1": "This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the benefits of standardized procurement procedures. The correct answer should highlight at least a few of the following benefits:\n\n*   **Cost Savings/Consistent Spending:**  Standardization helps in better budget control and potentially negotiating better prices due to consolidated purchasing.\n*   **Reduced Duplication:** Prevents departments from buying the same equipment unnecessarily.\n*   **Improved Inventory Management:**  Allows for better tracking of assets and avoids loss or misplacement.\n*   **Efficiency and Streamlining:**  Creates a more organized and efficient procurement process compared to ad-hoc purchasing.\n*   **Compliance and Auditability:**  Establishes a clear audit trail for all purchases.\n\nThe provided answer concisely covers the most important benefits.",
        "answer_q2": "This question tests the candidate's ability to identify essential information needed for a procurement request.  A good answer should include details that are necessary for the Procurement Officer to understand the need and process the request effectively. Key pieces of information include:\n\n*   **Department Identification:**  Knowing which department is requesting is crucial for budgeting and allocation.\n*   **Requester Information:**  Knowing who to contact for clarifications.\n*   **Item Description (with Specifications):**  Clear description of what is needed, including any necessary technical specifications to avoid ordering incorrect items.\n*   **Quantity:**  The number of units required.\n*   **Justification/Reason for Need:**  Understanding why the equipment is needed helps in prioritizing and validating the request.\n*   **Approval Indication:**  Confirmation that the Department Head has approved the request.\n\nThe provided answer includes these essential elements.",
        "answer_q3": "This question assesses the candidate's understanding of practical implementation challenges and mitigation strategies.  A common challenge when implementing new procedures, especially in decentralized environments, is resistance to change.  A good answer should identify a realistic challenge and suggest a practical mitigation strategy.\n\n*   **Challenge Identification:**  Resistance to change, lack of understanding of the new process, initial confusion, or increased workload perception are all valid challenges.\n*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Communication, training, providing support, phased implementation, or highlighting the benefits are effective mitigation strategies.\n\nThe provided answer identifies 'resistance to change' as a challenge and suggests communication, training, and support as mitigation, which are practical and relevant.",
        "general_guidance": "Answers should be concise and directly address the questions.  Evaluators should look for demonstration of practical understanding of procurement processes and policy formulation rather than perfect or overly complex answers. The focus is on foundational competence."
    },
    "passing_criteria": {
        "procedure_document": "To pass the procedure document section, the candidate's submission should include at least 6 out of the 9 keywords listed in `answer_key.procedure_document_keywords` AND demonstrate a logical flow covering the key stages of procurement (need identification, approval, procurement, receiving, recording). The procedure should be reasonably clear and practically applicable to the scenario.",
        "short_answer_questions": "To pass the short answer questions section, the candidate must provide essentially correct answers to at least 2 out of the 3 questions.  'Essentially correct' means capturing the core meaning and key points of the ideal answer, even if worded slightly differently.  Minor deviations in wording are acceptable as long as the core concept is accurately conveyed.",
        "overall_passing": "A candidate passes the basic exam if they meet the passing criteria for BOTH the procedure document section AND the short answer questions section."
    },
    "validation_method": {
        "procedure_document_validation": "To programmatically validate the procedure document:\n\n1.  **Keyword Check:** Count the number of keywords from `answer_key.procedure_document_keywords` present in the candidate's `procedure_document` (case-insensitive).\n2.  **Logical Flow Check (Manual or Semi-Automated):**  While fully automated logical flow validation is complex, a semi-automated approach can be used.  Check for the presence of steps or sections that correspond to the key stages:\n    *   Need Identification/Request\n    *   Department Head Approval\n    *   Procurement Officer Action (Quotes, PO)\n    *   Receiving Equipment\n    *   Record Keeping/Inventory\n    This can be done by looking for section headings or keywords related to these stages within the procedure document.\n\n   A simple script could count keyword matches and then a human evaluator can quickly review the document for logical flow if the keyword count is above a certain threshold (e.g., 6 keywords).",
        "short_answer_validation": "For short answer questions, use exact string matching (case-insensitive and ignoring extra whitespace) against the `answer_key.answer_q1`, `answer_key.answer_q2`, and `answer_key.answer_q3`.  Alternatively, use a fuzzy matching algorithm or keyword-based scoring if more flexibility is needed, but for a basic exam, exact or near-exact matching should be sufficient for these concise answers."
