        "recommended_supplier": "Lenovo",
        "justification": "After evaluating all three suppliers, I recommend Lenovo for Tech Solutions Inc.'s purchase of 50 business laptops. Lenovo offers the best combination of price, availability, and reputation. Price-wise, Lenovo provides the most competitive estimate at $800-$900 per laptop, which is lower than both Dell ($850-$950) and CDW ($890-$940). Regarding availability, while CDW has the shortest lead time at 3-5 days, Lenovo's 1-2 week lead time is still reasonable and significantly better than Dell's 10-15 business days. In terms of reputation, Lenovo has the highest rating (4.3/5) among the three suppliers, with their ThinkPad line specifically recognized for durability and reliability - important factors for business laptops. Dell has a comparable reputation (4.2/5) and excellent support, but at a higher price point and longer lead time. CDW offers good service as a reseller, but doesn't provide the same direct manufacturer relationship and has a slightly lower reputation score (4.0/5). The ThinkPad's renowned durability will likely result in fewer replacements over time, providing additional long-term value for Tech Solutions Inc. The combination of competitive pricing, reasonable lead time, and superior reputation makes Lenovo the optimal choice for this purchase."
