    "data_analysis_summary": "Analysis of last month's sales data reveals that 'Black Pens' and 'A4 Paper' are high-demand items with relatively low current stock levels, indicated by their high quantity sold (250 and 120 respectively) and lower current stock (30 and 25 respectively). 'Stapler' appears to be significantly overstocked with a current stock level of 150, despite only 15 units sold last month. 'Blue Pens', 'Sticky Notes', and 'Printer Paper' show moderate sales and reasonable stock levels. Items like 'Red Pens', 'Paper Clips', 'Envelopes', 'Highlighters', 'File Folders', 'Scissors', 'Tape', 'Ruler', 'Calculator', 'Desk Organizer', 'Whiteboard Markers', 'Correction Tape', 'Staple Remover', and 'Puncher' have lower sales volumes and generally adequate to high stock levels.",
    "identified_supply_issues": [
        {
            "item_name": "Black Pens",
            "reasoning": "Black Pens have the highest sales volume last month (250) and a very low current stock level (30). This results in a low days of supply and is directly supported by employee feedback stating they are 'frequently running out of black pens'. This indicates a clear understocking issue requiring immediate attention."
        },
        {
            "item_name": "A4 Paper",
            "reasoning": "A4 Paper also shows high demand with 120 units sold last month, and a low current stock level of 25. Employee feedback confirms this issue, mentioning it's 'hard to find A4 paper in the printer room'. This combination of sales data, low stock, and employee feedback highlights A4 Paper as a critical item needing immediate purchasing action."
        },
        {
            "item_name": "Stapler",
            "reasoning": "While not a supply shortage, Staplers are identified as an issue due to significant overstocking. With only 15 units sold last month and a current stock of 150, there is an excessive inventory. Employee feedback also mentions 'There seems to be a lot of staplers everywhere, we definitely don't need more of those.' This indicates inefficient inventory management and potential unnecessary capital tied up in staplers."

                "target_inventory_level": 300,
                "target_level_reasoning": "To ensure approximately 1.5 months of supply based on last month's sales of 250, and to act as a buffer against stockouts given the high demand and negative feedback. This also accounts for potential slight increases in demand.",
                "reorder_point": 100,
                "reorder_point_reasoning": "To trigger reordering when stock level drops to a point that allows for lead time (assuming a short lead time, e.g., 1 week's worth of sales which is roughly 60-70 pens) plus a safety stock buffer. Reordering at 100 pens should prevent stockouts before new stock arrives."

                "target_level_reasoning": "To maintain approximately 2 months of supply based on last month's sales of 120, and to address employee complaints about paper availability. A slightly higher target level for paper is reasonable as it's a staple office supply.",
                "reorder_point": 80,
                "reorder_point_reasoning": "To trigger reordering when stock reaches a level that covers approximately 3 weeks of sales (around 90 sheets) plus a safety buffer. Reordering at 80 sheets should provide sufficient time to replenish stock before running out."

                "target_level_reasoning": "To increase the current stock level and maintain approximately 1.5 months of supply based on last month's sales of 90. While not as critical as A4, printer paper is essential. Increasing the target level will ensure better availability.",
                "reorder_point": 60,
                "reorder_point_reasoning": "To reorder when stock level falls to approximately 2 weeks of sales (around 45 sheets) plus a safety buffer. Reordering at 60 sheets will allow for timely replenishment and prevent potential shortages."

    "employee_access_strategy": "This purchasing plan directly addresses the identified supply issues for Black Pens and A4 Paper, which were highlighted in employee feedback as frequently running out. By setting appropriate target inventory levels and reorder points based on sales data, the plan aims to ensure that these essential items are consistently in stock. Regularly reviewing and adjusting the plan monthly will allow for dynamic adaptation to changing demand and prevent future stockouts, thus ensuring employees have uninterrupted access to necessary office supplies to perform their jobs effectively."
