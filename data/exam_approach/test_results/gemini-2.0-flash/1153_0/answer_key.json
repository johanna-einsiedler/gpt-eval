    "data_analysis_summary": "Analysis of sales data reveals high demand for Black Pens and A4 Paper, with 250 and 120 units sold last month respectively. Current inventory for these items is low at 30 and 25 units. Staplers and Envelopes appear overstocked with current inventory at 150 and 120 units, while sales were only 15 and 70 units respectively. Sticky Notes and Printer Paper also show moderate sales and relatively lower stock, suggesting potential need for attention. Employee feedback confirms issues with Black Pens and A4 Paper availability.",

            "item_name": "A4 Paper",
            "reasoning": "A4 Paper has the second highest sales volume (120 last month) and a critically low current stock (25). Employee feedback mentions difficulty finding A4 paper, especially towards the end of the week, highlighting a supply shortage."

While employee feedback says they are 'usually available', the stock level is getting close to being low relative to sales, suggesting a potential future stockout risk if not monitored and proactively purchased."

                "target_level_reasoning": "Target inventory is set at 300 to cover more than one month's sales (250) and provide a safety stock to prevent frequent stockouts, addressing the critical employee feedback. This also accounts for potential slight increase in demand.",

                "target_level_reasoning": "Target inventory of 150 aims to slightly exceed last month's sales (120) and provide a buffer to address employee complaints about shortages, especially towards the week's end. This provides a reasonable safety stock.",

                "reorder_point": 40,
                "reorder_point_reasoning": "Reorder point of 40 is set to trigger reordering when stock falls to a level that is still above current stock (50) but approaching a point where reordering is necessary to maintain the target level and prevent potential future issues. This allows for timely restocking."

    "employee_access_strategy": "This purchasing plan directly addresses employee access to supplies by focusing on maintaining adequate stock levels for high-demand items like Black Pens and A4 Paper, which were specifically highlighted in employee feedback as problem areas. By setting target inventory levels and reorder points, the plan aims to proactively prevent stockouts and ensure these essential supplies are consistently available when employees need them. Regular monthly reviews will allow for adjustments based on changing demand or feedback, further ensuring ongoing employee access to necessary office supplies."
