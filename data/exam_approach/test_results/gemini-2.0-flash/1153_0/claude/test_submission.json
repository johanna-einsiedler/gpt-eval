    "data_analysis_summary": "Analysis of the sales and inventory data reveals several critical supply management issues. Black Pens show the highest demand (250 units sold) with dangerously low current stock (30 units), creating an immediate shortage risk. A4 Paper also shows high demand (120 units sold) with critically low inventory (25 units), indicating an existing shortage. Conversely, Staplers show minimal demand (15 units sold) but excessive inventory (150 units), suggesting significant overstocking. Other items with potential supply concerns include Sticky Notes (80 sold/50 in stock) and Printer Paper (90 sold/70 in stock), while items like Envelopes (70 sold/120 in stock) and Paper Clips (60 sold/100 in stock) appear adequately stocked.",
    "identified_supply_issues": [
        {
            "item_name": "Black Pens",
            "reasoning": "Black Pens represent our most critical supply issue based on three key data points: 1) They have the highest sales volume at 250 units last month, 2) Current inventory is only 30 units, which is insufficient to meet even 15% of monthly demand, and 3) Employee feedback specifically mentions 'frequently running out of black pens' as a frustration point. The current stock-to-sales ratio of 0.12 indicates an immediate replenishment need."
        },
        {
            "item_name": "A4 Paper",
            "reasoning": "A4 Paper requires immediate attention based on: 1) High monthly sales of 120 units, 2) Critically low current inventory of only 25 units (representing just 21% of monthly demand), and 3) Direct employee feedback stating 'it's hard to find A4 paper in the printer room, especially towards the end of the week.' This combination of high demand, low stock, and confirmed employee impact makes this a priority item."
        },
        {
            "item_name": "Sticky Notes",
            "reasoning": "Sticky Notes represent our third priority issue because: 1) They show relatively high demand with 80 units sold last month, 2) Current inventory is only 50 units, which provides only 62.5% of monthly demand, and 3) While employee feedback mentions sticky notes are 'usually available,' the current inventory-to-sales ratio suggests this positive perception may soon change without intervention. This item requires attention before it becomes a visible problem."

                "target_inventory_level": 375,
                "target_level_reasoning": "The target inventory level of 375 units is calculated as 1.5 times the monthly demand (250 units) to provide a 50% buffer. This level ensures we can accommodate unexpected usage spikes or delivery delays while maintaining consistent availability. Given the high usage rate and explicit employee complaints about availability, this higher buffer is justified to prevent disruptions to daily operations.",
                "reorder_point": 125,
                "reorder_point_reasoning": "The reorder point of 125 units (50% of monthly usage) provides a two-week supply buffer assuming consistent usage patterns. This allows sufficient lead time for order processing and delivery while maintaining adequate stock. Since black pens are identified as a critical supply with frequent stockouts, this higher reorder point helps ensure new inventory arrives before stock reaches critically low levels."

                "item_name": "A4 Paper",
                "target_inventory_level": 180,
                "target_level_reasoning": "The target inventory level of 180 units represents 1.5 times the monthly demand (120 units). This provides a 50% safety buffer to accommodate usage fluctuations and prevent the end-of-week shortages mentioned in employee feedback. Paper is essential for daily operations, and running out can significantly impact productivity, justifying this buffer level.",
                "reorder_point": 60,
                "reorder_point_reasoning": "The reorder point of 60 units (50% of monthly usage) ensures we initiate reordering when approximately two weeks of supply remains. This timing accounts for potential delivery delays while preventing the end-of-week shortages mentioned in employee feedback. Since A4 paper is bulky to store but critical for operations, this reorder point balances storage efficiency with consistent availability."

                "target_inventory_level": 120,
                "target_level_reasoning": "The target inventory level of 120 units provides 1.5 times the monthly demand (80 units), creating a 50% buffer. While sticky notes aren't as critical as pens or paper, they remain a frequently used item. This target level ensures consistent availability while preventing the current situation where inventory (50 units) is below monthly demand (80 units).",
                "reorder_point": 40,
                "reorder_point_reasoning": "The reorder point of 40 units (50% of monthly usage) initiates reordering when approximately two weeks of supply remains. This provides adequate time for order processing and delivery while maintaining sufficient stock. Since sticky notes are currently perceived as 'usually available' according to employee feedback, this reorder point helps maintain this positive perception."

        "review_frequency": "Bi-weekly"
    },
    "employee_access_strategy": "This purchasing plan addresses the critical supply issues identified through data analysis and employee feedback by implementing three key strategies: 1) Setting appropriate target inventory levels that include safety buffers based on actual usage patterns, 2) Establishing reorder points that trigger replenishment before supplies reach critical levels, and 3) Implementing a bi-weekly review cycle to quickly identify and address emerging supply issues. For high-demand items like Black Pens and A4 Paper, we've created larger safety buffers to ensure consistent availability throughout the workweek. The plan also includes redistributing excess inventory of overstocked items like Staplers to free up storage space for more critical supplies. By maintaining appropriate stock levels of essential items and regularly reviewing usage patterns, employees will have reliable access to the supplies they need, eliminating the frustration of searching for basic items and improving overall workplace productivity."
