    "answer_explanation": {
        "question_1": {
            "correct_answer_description": "Correct answers will identify at least three distinct suppliers of standard white printer paper (8.5 x 11 inches) available online.  Suppliers should be recognizable office supply retailers or online marketplaces. The information provided for each supplier should be accurate and readily available on the supplier's website.",
            "derivation": "Candidates are expected to use a web browser to search for 'printer paper 8.5 x 11' or similar terms. They should then navigate to the websites of reputable office supply stores (e.g., Staples, Office Depot, Amazon, Walmart, Target, etc.) and locate standard white printer paper.  The required information (Supplier Name, Website URL, Price per ream, Brand, and Specifications) should be extracted directly from the product pages.",
            "validation_notes": "Evaluators should verify that the provided URLs are valid and lead to the listed supplier's website.  The 'price_per_ream', 'paper_brand', and 'paper_specifications' should reasonably match the information available on the linked page at the time of evaluation. Minor price variations due to temporary sales or promotions are acceptable, but significant discrepancies should be reviewed. Ensure the specifications (brightness and weight) are mentioned and are within the standard range (brightness around 92, weight around 20lb or 75gsm)."
        },
        "question_2": {
            "correct_answer_description": "Correct answers will accurately calculate the total cost for purchasing 20 reams of paper from each of the identified suppliers. The calculation should be based on multiplying the 'price_per_ream' by the 'total_reams_needed' (which is 20, derived from Question 3).",
            "derivation": "The total cost is calculated by multiplying the 'price_per_ream' obtained in Question 1 by the total quantity of reams needed for the month (calculated in Question 3 as 20 reams). For example, if Supplier 1's price per ream is $9.99, the total cost is 20 * $9.99 = $199.80.",
            "validation_notes": "The 'total_cost_for_month' should be mathematically correct based on the 'price_per_ream' provided for each supplier in Question 1 and the 'total_reams_needed' from Question 3.  Formula: `total_cost_for_month = price_per_ream * total_reams_needed`.  Check for correct multiplication and rounding to two decimal places if necessary. Currency consistency should be maintained (implicitly USD, EUR, etc., based on the context of the search)."
        },
        "question_3": {
            "correct_answer_description": "The correct answer for 'total_reams_needed' is 20. This is derived from multiplying the weekly usage (5 reams) by the number of weeks in a month (4 weeks).",
            "derivation": "The calculation is straightforward: Weekly usage (5 reams/week) * Number of weeks (4 weeks) = Total reams needed (20 reams).",
            "validation_notes": "Verify that 'weekly_usage_reams' is 5, 'weeks_in_month' is 4, and 'total_reams_needed' is correctly calculated as 20. Formula: `total_reams_needed = weekly_usage_reams * weeks_in_month`."
        },
        "question_4": {
            "correct_answer_description": "The 'chosen_supplier_name' should be one of the suppliers identified in Question 1. The 'justification' should logically explain the choice, primarily focusing on price and quality.  The best answer is subjective but should demonstrate a rational decision-making process based on the provided data.",
            "derivation": "Candidates should review the 'supplier_analysis' data, particularly the 'total_cost_for_month' and 'paper_specifications'. The justification should explain why the chosen supplier is the most suitable option, considering the goal of purchasing the highest quality merchandise at the lowest possible price.  A good justification will mention price competitiveness and confirm that the paper quality (brightness, weight) meets the basic requirements.",
            "validation_notes": "Evaluate the 'justification' for logical reasoning. Does it clearly state why the chosen supplier was selected? Does it mention price as a factor? Does it acknowledge the quality aspect (even if briefly)?  A justification that solely focuses on the lowest price is acceptable if the quality is implicitly assumed to be standard.  A justification that ignores price and focuses on less relevant factors (e.g., website design) would be considered weak.  The chosen supplier should ideally be the one offering the lowest total cost, assuming comparable quality. If a slightly more expensive supplier is chosen, the justification should explain why (e.g., faster shipping, better brand reputation - although these are not explicitly tested in this basic exam)."

            "question_1_supplier_sourcing": "Successfully identify at least three valid suppliers with accurate information (supplier name, website URL, price, brand, and specifications). All three supplier entries should be reasonably complete and accurate.",
            "question_2_price_comparison": "Accurately calculate the 'total_cost_for_month' for at least two out of three suppliers. Minor calculation errors for one supplier may be acceptable if the overall understanding of price comparison is demonstrated.",
            "question_3_quantity_calculation": "Correctly calculate the 'total_reams_needed' as 20. This is a critical objective calculation and must be accurate.",
            "question_4_supplier_selection_justification": "Select a supplier and provide a reasonable justification that primarily considers price and quality. The justification should be logical and demonstrate an understanding of basic purchasing principles. Choosing the lowest-cost supplier with acceptable quality is considered a strong indication of competence at this basic level."
        },
        "minimum_correct_answers": "All questions are considered essential.  Candidates should aim to fully meet the criteria for each section to pass.  Partial credit may be considered at the evaluator's discretion for minor errors, but significant omissions or incorrect approaches should result in failing the basic exam.",
        "subjective_evaluation_component": "Question 4 ('Supplier Selection & Justification') involves a subjective element in evaluating the justification. Evaluators should assess the reasoning provided for clarity, relevance to price and quality, and overall coherence. A well-reasoned justification, even if not perfectly worded, should be considered positively."

            "question_2_price_comparison": "Automated scripts can verify the 'total_cost_for_month' by recalculating it using the provided 'price_per_ream' and the fixed 'total_reams_needed' (20). Compare the calculated value with the candidate's submitted 'total_cost_for_month' for each supplier. Allow for a small tolerance for rounding errors if necessary.",
            "question_3_quantity_calculation": "Automated scripts can directly check if 'total_reams_needed' is equal to 20, 'weekly_usage_reams' is 5, and 'weeks_in_month' is 4."

Assess if the identified suppliers are reasonable choices for office supplies.",
            "question_4_supplier_selection_justification": "Manually review the 'justification' text. Assess if the justification logically supports the 'chosen_supplier_name'. Check if the justification mentions price and quality considerations. Evaluate the overall reasoning and clarity of the justification. Look for keywords related to cost-effectiveness and quality suitability."
