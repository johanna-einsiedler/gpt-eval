    "1": "Regulation Name: ISO 14001, URL: https://www.iso.org/iso-14001-environmental-management.html",
    "2": "The 'Gifts and Hospitality' section of the ethical sourcing policy prohibits purchasing employees from accepting or offering cash, lavish gifts, or excessive hospitality that could unduly influence purchasing decisions.  It specifically bans gifts during tender processes and gifts that might create a sense of obligation. This is crucial for legal and ethical compliance because it directly addresses anti-bribery and corruption laws, ensures fair competition among suppliers based on merit rather than favors, upholds the company's ethical reputation, and maintains objectivity in purchasing decisions, preventing conflicts of interest and ensuring decisions are made in the best interest of the company.",
    "3": "Labor laws and regulations are highly relevant to supplier selection because they directly relate to the ethical and social responsibility aspects of sourcing.  Suppliers who violate labor laws can expose the purchasing company to significant legal, financial, and reputational risks.  For example, 'Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) regulations' are particularly relevant.  Ensuring suppliers adhere to OSH standards is crucial to protect worker safety and well-being, and to avoid potential liabilities and negative publicity associated with unsafe working conditions in the supply chain.",
    "4": "Step 1: I would begin by using a search engine like Google and entering search terms such as 'import regulations [new country name]' or 'import export requirements [new country name]'. This initial search would aim to identify general overviews and potentially point towards official government resources or trade portals. Step 2:  Following the initial broad search, I would specifically seek out the official website of the [new country name]'s customs authority or ministry of trade.  I would search for terms like '[new country name] customs' or '[new country name] ministry of trade' to locate their official online presence. These official government websites are the most reliable sources for detailed and up-to-date information on import/export regulations, tariffs, required documentation, and any specific trade agreements."
