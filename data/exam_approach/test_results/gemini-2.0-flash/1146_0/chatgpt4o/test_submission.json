This is crucial for maintaining legal and ethical compliance as it prevents bribery and corruption, ensuring that purchasing decisions are made objectively and based on merit rather than personal gain. This helps uphold the company's reputation and ensures fair competition among suppliers.",
    "3": "Labor laws and regulations are relevant in supplier selection to ensure ethical sourcing and compliance with legal standards. For example, adherence to 'wage and hour laws' is critical to ensure that suppliers treat their workers fairly and pay them according to legal requirements. This not only protects workers' rights but also mitigates reputational and legal risks for the purchasing company.",
