    "scenario_1": {
        "question_1": "Yes, potential coverage exists if the policy excerpt includes coverage for accidental discharge of water or similar perils. To confirm, I would need to see if 'Sudden and Accidental Discharge of Water' is listed as a covered peril in the policy excerpt.",
        "question_2": "Two relevant pieces of information from the Scenario1_ClaimForm.pdf would be: 1) The reported 'Cause of Damage' (e.g., burst pipe, leaking appliance) as this needs to be a covered peril. 2) The 'Date of Loss' to ensure the policy was active at the time of the incident.",
        "question_3": "One key piece of missing information is the cause of the water damage in detail.  Knowing if the damage was due to negligence, lack of maintenance, or a sudden and accidental event is crucial for coverage determination, and this level of detail might not be fully captured in the initial claim form."
    },
    "scenario_2": {
        "question_1": "Yes, the Scenario2_PolicyExcerpt.pdf should provide liability coverage if it contains a section covering 'Liability for Property Damage' or similar, which is standard in auto insurance policies. This section would outline the insurer's obligation to pay for damages to another vehicle if the policyholder is at fault.",
        "question_2": "To answer this, I would need to review the Scenario2_ClaimForm.pdf.  Assuming the claim form asks for details about the accident and fault, I would look for sections like 'Driver at Fault', 'Reported Cause of Accident', or 'Police Report Details' to identify who is reported to be at fault.  For example, the claim form might state 'Insured Driver' or 'Other Driver' was at fault based on the claimant's perspective.",
        "question_3": "The most directly relevant section in the Scenario2_PolicyExcerpt.pdf would likely be titled 'Liability Coverage', 'Automobile Liability', or something similar.  It might also be section numbered, such as 'Section II - Liability'."
    },
    "scenario_3": {
        "question_1": "Yes, business interruption coverage due to fire damage is a common feature in commercial property policies. The Scenario3_PolicyExcerpt.pdf should mention 'Business Interruption Coverage' or 'Loss of Business Income' and list 'Fire' as a covered cause of loss to confirm potential coverage.",
        "question_2": "According to the Scenario3_ClaimForm.pdf, the reported cause of business interruption would be stated in a section describing the 'Cause of Loss' or 'Description of Incident'.  For example, it might state 'Fire Damage to Premises' or 'Building Fire'.",
        "question_3": "Yes, business interruption policies often have a waiting period before coverage begins. I would look for sections in the Scenario3_PolicyExcerpt.pdf titled 'Waiting Period', 'Period of Indemnity', or 'Deductible Period' within the Business Interruption coverage section to confirm if a waiting period is explicitly mentioned."
