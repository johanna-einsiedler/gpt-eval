            "trend_description": "TikTok and short-form content have become central to pop music marketing and discovery. The platform's algorithm and user behavior have changed how songs become hits, with brief, catchy sections of songs often driving viral success.",
            "impact": "Artists are now creating music with 'TikTok moments' in mind - crafting songs with sections specifically designed to be used in short videos. This has altered song structures, with hooks appearing earlier and being more prominent. Record labels are prioritizing TikTok promotion in marketing campaigns, and artists who effectively leverage the platform can rapidly build audiences and streaming numbers. This trend has also shortened the typical hit cycle, with songs rising and falling in popularity more quickly than in previous eras.",
