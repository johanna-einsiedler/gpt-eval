            "reasoning": "Minimum selling price with 22% margin = $82.50/(1-0.22) = $105.77. Since this is below competitor's $129.99, we can match their price while maintaining required margin"

            "answer": "Vendor B",
            "reasoning": "Despite slightly higher total cost ($35,640 vs $33,750), Vendor B offers better inventory management with smaller minimum order (500 vs 1000), better cash flow with 60-day terms, and flexibility with reorders. These benefits outweigh the modest cost difference."
