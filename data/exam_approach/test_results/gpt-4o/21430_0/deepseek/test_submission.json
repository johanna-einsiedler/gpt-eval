The claimant reported a minor fender bender but submitted a repair estimate of $12,000, which is significantly higher than the average cost for such incidents. Additionally, the claimant's vehicle is an older model with a market value below the claimed amount.\n\nPlease investigate for possible exaggeration or misrepresentation of damages. Attached are the claim form, photos, and repair estimate for your review.\n\nThank you,\n[Your Name]\nClaims Adjuster"
