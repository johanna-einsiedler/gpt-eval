        "notes": "I organized the claims requiring detailed analysis by categorizing them based on issue type and severity. I created a structured format that includes the Claim ID, Claimant Name, Issue Description, and added columns for Priority Level and Next Steps. I faced challenges with some ambiguous issue descriptions that required additional context, which I noted in a separate section. I also included a summary of common issues identified across multiple claims to help identify potential patterns."
