        "notes": "For Task 2, I reviewed the PDF document and created a text document listing each claim requiring further analysis. I organized the claims by Claim ID and included the Claimant Name and the Brief Description of the Issue as provided in the PDF.  I approached this by systematically extracting the information for each claim and structuring it clearly in the text document for easy review. No significant challenges were encountered as the PDF was straightforward to interpret."
