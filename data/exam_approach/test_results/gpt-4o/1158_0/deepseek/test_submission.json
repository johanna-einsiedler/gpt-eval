        "Trends": "The price data shows three distinct phases over the past year: 1) A steady increase of approximately 18% over the first 6 months, likely due to rising industrial demand. 2) A plateau period lasting about 3 months where prices fluctuated within a 5% band. 3) A sharp decline of 12% in the final quarter, possibly indicating reduced demand or increased supply. The overall annual trend shows a modest 3% net increase despite the late-year drop.",
        "Anomalies": "Two significant anomalies were observed: 1) A sudden 8% price spike in Week 22 that lasted only one week before returning to the established trend line. 2) An unusual 5-day consecutive drop in Week 42 totaling 9%, which broke the established support level. Both events occurred without obvious immediate news triggers in the dataset."

    "Task 2": {
        "Summary": "Current market research indicates copper prices are being influenced by multiple factors: 1) Supply constraints from major producers in Chile due to labor disputes. 2) Weaker-than-expected demand from China's construction sector. 3) Increased inventory levels at LME warehouses. 4) The energy transition (EVs, renewables) continues to provide long-term demand support. Analysts are divided on near-term direction, with some predicting further declines while others see current prices as a buying opportunity.",
