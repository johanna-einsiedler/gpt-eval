    "Task 1": {
        "Trends": "Based on the hypothetical commodity price data, I would analyze seasonal patterns, overall price trajectory (upward, downward, or stable), and identify any cyclical patterns. For example, I might note: 'The commodity showed a general upward trend from January through May, followed by a plateau during summer months, and a gradual decline in Q4. This pattern suggests seasonal demand fluctuations, with peak consumption occurring in spring.'",
        "Anomalies": "Without the actual data, I would typically identify price spikes or drops that deviate significantly from the trend line. For example: 'A notable price spike of approximately 15% occurred in mid-March, which coincided with supply chain disruptions reported in major producing regions. Additionally, an unexpected price drop of 8% in early October did not align with seasonal patterns and may warrant further investigation into potential market oversupply or reduced demand factors.'"
    },
    "Task 2": {
        "Summary": "For this commodity market, several key factors are currently influencing supply and demand dynamics. Global economic recovery post-pandemic has increased industrial demand by approximately 7% year-over-year, while production capacity has only expanded by 3%. Environmental regulations in major producing countries have constrained supply growth, particularly in Asia where new emissions standards have forced several producers to temporarily halt operations for compliance upgrades. Weather events, including drought conditions in South America, have affected agricultural inputs for this commodity, creating upstream supply constraints. Additionally, technological innovations in alternative materials are beginning to create substitution effects in certain applications, potentially capping long-term price growth despite current supply limitations.",
