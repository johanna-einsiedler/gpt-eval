        {
            "question_number": 1,
            "selected_option": "b",
            "justification": "Supplier B offers the lowest price per unit at $2.30, which is the most cost-effective option. While the delivery time is slightly longer, the price difference compensates for this, and the 1-year warranty is sufficient for most applications."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 2,
            "selected_option": "a",
            "justification": "The shipment meets all required quality standards, with a high pass rate and acceptable lifespan. The minor cosmetic defects and slightly lower MTBF do not justify rejection or a discount, as they do not significantly impact functionality."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 3,
            "selected_option": "b",
            "justification": "Using the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) formula, the most economical order quantity is calculated to be approximately 1,549 units. This minimizes the total cost of ordering and holding inventory while meeting demand and safety stock requirements."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 4,
            "selected_option": "a",
            "justification": "Supplier X offers the best balance of quality compliance (98%) and on-time delivery (95%) at a reasonable price index. While Supplier Y has better delivery, its higher price and slightly lower quality compliance make Supplier X the better choice for critical components."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 5,
            "selected_option": "c",
            "justification": "The '2/10 net 30' term offers a 2% discount for payment within 10 days. Annualizing this discount over 12 months results in a 36.5% savings, as the discount can be taken multiple times per year."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 6,
            "selected_option": "b",
            "justification": "Accepting a consultant fee from a supplier is unethical and could create a conflict of interest. The appropriate action is to decline the offer and report it to ensure transparency and maintain professional integrity."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 7,
            "selected_option": "a",
            "justification": "Option 1 has a lower total cost due to the volume discount. Purchasing 10,000 units at $5.75 with a 3% discount results in a lower per-unit cost compared to Option 2, which involves higher per-unit costs and no discount."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 8,
            "selected_option": "c",
            "justification": "Given the political instability and increased shipping times, both increasing safety stock and qualifying alternative suppliers are necessary. This dual approach mitigates immediate risks while ensuring long-term supply chain resilience."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 9,
            "selected_option": "b",
            "justification": "Ordering every 4 weeks aligns with the supplier's minimum order quantity of 3,000 units and meets the weekly demand of 800 units. This minimizes holding costs while ensuring the component's shelf life is not exceeded."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 10,
            "selected_option": "b",
            "justification": "Supplier profit margin is not typically included in a purchase order. Purchase orders focus on payment terms, delivery timeframe, and quality specifications, which are essential for the transaction but do not include internal supplier financial details."
