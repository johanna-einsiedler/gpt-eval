            "question_number": 1,
            "selected_option": "a",
            "justification": "Supplier A offers the best balance of price, delivery time, and warranty. While Supplier B has a lower unit price, their longer delivery time and shorter warranty period reduce overall value. Supplier A's 30-day delivery is reasonable, and the 2-year warranty provides better long-term protection than Supplier B's offering."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 2,
            "selected_option": "b",
            "justification": "The shipment has minor issues that don't warrant complete rejection but do justify a discount. The functional pass rate is high (98.5%), and the lifespan exceeds requirements, but the MTBF is slightly below industry standard and there are some cosmetic defects. A 5% discount appropriately addresses these quality concerns while still accepting usable components."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 3,
            "selected_option": "b",
            "justification": "Using the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) formula: √(2DS/H), where D=24,000 units annually, S=$150 ordering cost, and H=$5 holding cost (20% of $25), the calculation yields 1,549 units. This quantity minimizes the sum of ordering and holding costs, making it the most economical order quantity for the given parameters."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 4,
            "selected_option": "b",
            "justification": "Supplier Y has the highest on-time delivery rate (99%), which is critical for reliable supply chain operations. While their quality compliance is slightly lower than others, 96% is still excellent, and their superior financial stability rating (A-) indicates lower risk of supply disruption. For critical components where consistent delivery is paramount, Supplier Y represents the best choice."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 5,
            "selected_option": "c",
            "justification": "The term '2/10 net 30' means a 2% discount if paid within 10 days, otherwise full payment in 30 days. The annualized savings percentage is calculated as: 2% × (360/(30-10)) = 2% × 18 = 36%. This represents the annualized value of taking the early payment discount consistently throughout the year."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 6,
            "selected_option": "b",
            "justification": "The offered 'consultant fee' is an unethical attempt to influence the procurement decision and likely violates company policies and procurement ethics. The appropriate action is to decline the offer and report it to your supervisor immediately. Accepting such an offer could constitute a bribe and compromise the integrity of the procurement process."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 7,
            "selected_option": "a",
            "justification": "Option 1 costs: 10,000 units × $5.75 × 0.97 (after 3% discount) = $55,775. Option 2 costs: (7,500 × $5.90) + (2,500 × $5.95) = $44,250 + $14,875 = $59,125. Option 1 saves $3,350 compared to Option 2, making it the lower-cost option when considering the volume discount."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 8,
            "selected_option": "c",
            "justification": "The situation presents multiple serious risks: political instability, high capacity utilization, increasing shipping times, and single-sourcing. Implementing both increased safety stock and alternative supplier qualification provides immediate protection against short-term disruptions while developing a long-term solution. This comprehensive approach addresses both immediate and future supply chain risks."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 9,
            "selected_option": "b",
            "justification": "With weekly usage of 800 units and a minimum order quantity of 3,000 units, ordering every 4 weeks (3,000 ÷ 800 = 3.75 weeks) is optimal. This balances holding costs with the need to use inventory before its 6-month shelf life expires. Ordering every 3 weeks would require more frequent orders, while longer intervals would increase holding costs unnecessarily."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 10,
            "selected_option": "b",
            "justification": "Supplier profit margin is confidential supplier information that would not typically be included in a standard purchase order. Purchase orders normally include payment terms, delivery timeframes, and quality specifications, but the supplier's internal cost structure and profit margins remain proprietary to the supplier and are not documented in purchase orders."
