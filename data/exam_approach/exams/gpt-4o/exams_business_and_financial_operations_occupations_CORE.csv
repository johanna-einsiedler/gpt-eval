   - **Commission Rate:** The contract specifies a 10% commission rate.
   - **Payment Schedule:** The contract indicates payments are made monthly.
   - **Additional Fees:** There is a 5% administrative fee on the total earnings.
   - **Total Amount Due Calculation:**
     - Total earnings for the period: $50,000
     - Commission: 10% of $50,000 = $5,000
     - Administrative Fee: 5% of $50,000 = $2,500
     - Total Amount Due: $5,000 (commission) + $2,500 (fee) = $7,500

2. **Task 2: Payment Collection Simulation**
   - The email should be professional, clear, and polite, requesting the payment of $7,500.00. It should reference the contract terms, including the commission and additional fees, and provide contact information for any queries.

- **Task 2:** The candidate must draft a professional and clear payment request email that aligns with the contract terms and includes the correct total amount due.

To pass, the candidate must:
- Correctly complete Task 1 with all elements accurate.
- Draft a coherent and professional email in Task 2 that includes all necessary details.

### Validation Approach

To programmatically validate the answers, the following checks can be implemented:

1. **Task 1 Validation:**
   - Check if `commission_rate` is ""10%"".
   - Check if `payment_schedule` is ""monthly"".
   - Check if `additional_fees` includes ""5% administrative fee"".
   - Verify `total_amount_due` is ""$7,500.00"".

2. **Task 2 Validation:**
   - Ensure the email includes the correct total amount due of ""$7,500.00"".
   - Check for the presence of key phrases such as ""10% commission"", ""5% administrative fee"", and a polite request for payment.

By using these criteria and validation checks, the evaluator can ensure the candidate has demonstrated the necessary skills to collect fees, commissions, or other payments according to contract terms.","

### Explanation of Correct Answers

1. **Industry Trends:**
   - **Trend Summary:** The candidate should identify a current trend that is verifiable through credible sources. The summary should be concise and reflect a significant development in the industry.
   - **Impact:** The impact should logically follow from the trend and demonstrate an understanding of how it affects artists, performers, or athletes.

2. **Deal Analysis:**
   - **Parties Involved:** The candidate should accurately identify the main entities involved in the deal.
   - **Nature of Deal:** A clear description of what the deal entails, including any unique or noteworthy aspects.
   - **Significance:** The candidate should explain why the deal is important within the industry, showing insight into broader implications.

### Passing Criteria

- **Industry Trends:** At least 2 out of 3 trends must be accurately identified and explained with a logical impact.
- **Deal Analysis:** All three components (parties involved, nature of deal, significance) must be correctly identified and explained.

### Validation Approach

To programmatically validate the answers, the evaluator can use the following criteria:

1. **Industry Trends:**
   - Check if the trend summary is concise and matches known industry developments.
   - Validate the logical connection between the trend and its impact.

2. **Deal Analysis:**
   - Verify the accuracy of the parties involved and the nature of the deal using recent news or industry reports.
   - Assess the significance explanation for its relevance and insight.

A script could be developed to cross-reference the candidate's submission with a database of recent industry trends and deals to automate part of the validation process. However, due to the dynamic nature of the industry, human evaluation will still be necessary to account for nuances and context.","

Here is the information given to the evaluator: <evaluation_information> To create a comprehensive answer key and evaluation criteria for the basic practical exam, we need to ensure that the evaluator can effectively assess the candidate's ability to keep informed of industry trends and deals. Below is the detailed plan for the answer key, explanation, passing criteria, and validation approach.

### Answer Key in JSON Format

Since the exam requires candidates to research current trends and deals, the answer key will provide a sample response based on hypothetical or recent data. This will serve as a guideline for evaluators to compare against the candidate's submission.

```json
{
  ""candidate_id"": ""GPT-4-turbo"",
  ""industry_trends"": [
    {
      ""trend_summary"": ""The rise of virtual concerts and events due to advancements in VR technology."",
      ""impact"": ""Artists can reach a global audience without geographical constraints, potentially increasing revenue streams.""
    },
    {
      ""trend_summary"": ""Increased focus on mental health support for athletes."",
      ""impact"": ""Athletes are receiving better support systems, which can enhance performance and prolong careers.""
    },
    {
      ""trend_summary"": ""The growing influence of social media platforms in talent discovery."",
      ""impact"": ""Performers can gain visibility and opportunities through viral content, bypassing traditional industry gatekeepers.""
    }
  ],
  ""deal_analysis"": {
    ""parties_involved"": ""Universal Music Group and Taylor Swift"",
    ""nature_of_deal"": ""A multi-album recording contract with provisions for artist ownership of masters."",
    ""significance"": ""This deal highlights a shift towards artists gaining more control over their work, setting a precedent for future contracts.""
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

1. **Industry Trends:**
   - **Trend Summary:** The candidate should identify a current trend that is verifiable through credible sources. The summary should be concise and reflect a significant development in the industry.
   - **Impact:** The impact should logically follow from the trend and demonstrate an understanding of how it affects artists, performers, or athletes.

2. **Deal Analysis:**
   - **Parties Involved:** The candidate should accurately identify the main entities involved in the deal.
   - **Nature of Deal:** A clear description of what the deal entails, including any unique or noteworthy aspects.
   - **Significance:** The candidate should explain why the deal is important within the industry, showing insight into broader implications.

### Passing Criteria

- **Industry Trends:** At least 2 out of 3 trends must be accurately identified and explained with a logical impact.
- **Deal Analysis:** All three components (parties involved, nature of deal, significance) must be correctly identified and explained.

### Validation Approach

To programmatically validate the answers, the evaluator can use the following criteria:

1. **Industry Trends:**
   - Check if the trend summary is concise and matches known industry developments.
   - Validate the logical connection between the trend and its impact.

2. **Deal Analysis:**
   - Verify the accuracy of the parties involved and the nature of the deal using recent news or industry reports.
   - Assess the significance explanation for its relevance and insight.

A script could be developed to cross-reference the candidate's submission with a database of recent industry trends and deals to automate part of the validation process. However, due to the dynamic nature of the industry, human evaluation will still be necessary to account for nuances and context. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","To create the `task_evaluation.py` script, we need to design a program that reads the candidate's submission and the answer key, compares them, and evaluates the candidate's performance based on predefined criteria. Here's how the script can be structured:

```python
import json

def load_json(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

def evaluate_trends(candidate_trends, answer_trends):
    score = 0
    max_score = len(answer_trends)
    detailed_results = []

    for candidate_trend, answer_trend in zip(candidate_trends, answer_trends):
        trend_score = 0
        if candidate_trend['trend_summary'].strip().lower() == answer_trend['trend_summary'].strip().lower():
            trend_score += 0.5
        if candidate_trend['impact'].strip().lower() == answer_trend['impact'].strip().lower():
            trend_score += 0.5
        score += trend_score
        detailed_results.append({
            ""candidate_trend"": candidate_trend,
            ""answer_trend"": answer_trend,
            ""trend_score"": trend_score
        })

    return score, max_score, detailed_results

def evaluate_deal(candidate_deal, answer_deal):
    score = 0
    max_score = 3
    detailed_results = {}

    if candidate_deal['parties_involved'].strip().lower() == answer_deal['parties_involved'].strip().lower():
        score += 1
    if candidate_deal['nature_of_deal'].strip().lower() == answer_deal['nature_of_deal'].strip().lower():
        score += 1
    if candidate_deal['significance'].strip().lower() == answer_deal['significance'].strip().lower():
        score += 1

    detailed_results = {
        ""candidate_deal"": candidate_deal,
        ""answer_deal"": answer_deal,
        ""deal_score"": score
    }

    return score, max_score, detailed_results

def main():
    candidate_submission = load_json('test_submission.json')
    answer_key = load_json('answer_key.json')

    # Evaluate industry trends
    trend_score, trend_max_score, trend_results = evaluate_trends(
        candidate_submission['industry_trends'],
        answer_key['industry_trends']
    )

    # Evaluate deal analysis
    deal_score, deal_max_score, deal_results = evaluate_deal(
        candidate_submission['deal_analysis'],
        answer_key['deal_analysis']
    )

    # Calculate overall score
    total_score = trend_score + deal_score
    total_max_score = trend_max_score + deal_max_score
    overall_score = (total_score / total_max_score) * 100

    # Prepare results
    results = {
        ""trend_results"": trend_results,
        ""deal_results"": deal_results,
        ""overall_score"": overall_score
    }

        json.dump(results, result_file, indent=4)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":

```

### Explanation of the Script:

1. **Loading JSON Files:** The `load_json` function reads a JSON file and returns its content as a Python dictionary.

2. **Evaluating Industry Trends:** The `evaluate_trends` function compares each trend in the candidate's submission with the corresponding trend in the answer key. It awards 0.5 points for a correct trend summary and 0.5 points for a correct impact description.

3. **Evaluating Deal Analysis:** The `evaluate_deal` function checks the candidate's deal analysis against the answer key. It awards 1 point each for correctly identifying the parties involved, the nature of the deal, and its significance.

4. **Calculating Overall Score:** The script calculates the total score and converts it into a percentage.

5. **Saving Results:** The results, including detailed scoring and the overall score, are saved to a JSON file named `test_results.json`.

This script provides a structured way to evaluate the candidate's performance based on the provided answer key and submission."

The demand for Apples and Oranges is expected to remain stable with slight increases due to seasonal factors.""
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

1. **Task 1: Order Analysis**
   - **Total Quantities:** The candidate should sum the quantities for each product type from the provided spreadsheet. For example, if the spreadsheet shows multiple orders for Apples totaling 1500 units, this is the correct total quantity for Apples.
   - **Trends:** The candidate should identify any patterns, such as increasing or decreasing demand for specific products. This can be derived from observing changes in order quantities over time.

2. **Task 2: Demand Forecasting**
   - **Forecasted Demand:** The candidate should use historical sales data and market trends to predict future demand. For instance, if historical data shows a consistent increase in Banana sales and market reports suggest a growing trend, the candidate should forecast a higher demand for Bananas.
   - **Factors:** The explanation should include references to historical data and market trends. For example, if market reports highlight a health trend favoring Bananas, this should be mentioned as a factor influencing the forecast.

### Passing Criteria

- **Task 1:**
  - Correctly calculate total quantities for at least 2 out of 3 product types.
  - Identify at least one valid trend or pattern in the order data.

- **Task 2:**
  - Provide a reasonable forecast for at least 2 out of 3 product types.
  - Include a logical explanation of factors influencing the forecast.

To pass, the candidate must meet the criteria for both tasks.

### Validation Approach

To programmatically validate the answers, the following approach can be used:

1. **Total Quantities Validation:**
   - Compare the candidate's total quantities with the correct totals derived from the spreadsheet. Allow a small margin of error (e.g., ±5%) to account for minor calculation discrepancies.

2. **Trends and Factors Validation:**
   - Use keyword matching to check if the candidate's trends and factors include relevant terms from the provided data and market trends (e.g., ""increase"", ""stable"", ""health benefits"").

3. **Forecasted Demand Validation:**
   - Compare the candidate's forecasted quantities with the expected forecasts. Allow a margin of error (e.g., ±10%) to accommodate different interpretations of the data.

By using these validation methods, the evaluator can ensure that the candidate's answers are both accurate and reasonable based on the provided materials.","

```

### Explanation of Correct Answers and How They Were Derived

**Task 1: Mark-Up Rate Recommendation**

- **Product 1:** A mark-up rate of 30% was recommended based on the cost price and competitive market pricing. The candidate should have analyzed the cost and compared it with similar products in the market to ensure a competitive yet profitable price.
- **Product 2:** A mark-up rate of 25% was chosen due to slightly lower market competition, allowing for a smaller mark-up while maintaining profitability.
- **Product 3:** A higher mark-up rate of 35% was recommended due to a niche market position or higher perceived value, allowing for a greater profit margin.

**Task 2: Mark-Down Rate and Selling Price Recommendation**

- **Product 1:** A mark-down rate of 10% was applied to improve sales, with a new selling price of $18.99. This was calculated by reducing the current price by 10% and rounding to the nearest cent.
- **Product 2:** A 15% mark-down was recommended, resulting in a new selling price of $22.49. This decision was based on inventory levels and sales performance data indicating a need for a more aggressive price reduction.
- **Product 3:** A 20% mark-down was necessary due to significant underperformance, leading to a new selling price of $15.99. This was calculated by applying the mark-down to the current price and adjusting for market competitiveness.

### Passing Criteria

- **Task 1:** The candidate must correctly recommend mark-up rates for at least 2 out of 3 products.
- **Task 2:** The candidate must correctly recommend mark-down rates and new selling prices for at least 2 out of 3 products.
- Overall, the candidate must achieve at least 4 out of 6 correct recommendations to pass.

### Programmatic Validation of Answers

To validate the candidate's answers programmatically, we can use a simple script that checks the submitted JSON against the answer key. Here's a basic validation script in Python:

```python
import json

def validate_submission(submission_file, answer_key_file):
    with open(submission_file, 'r') as sub_file, open(answer_key_file, 'r') as ans_file:
        submission = json.load(sub_file)
        answer_key = json.load(ans_file)
        
        correct_count = 0
        total_count = 0
        
        for task in ['task_1', 'task_2']:
            for product, answers in answer_key[task].items():
                total_count += len(answers)
                for key, correct_value in answers.items():
                    if submission[task][product][key] == correct_value:
                        correct_count += 1
        
        return correct_count, total_count

# Example usage
correct, total = validate_submission('test_submission.json', 'answer_key.json')
print(f""Correct Answers: {correct}/{total}"")
```

This script will read the candidate's submission and the answer key, compare the values, and count the number of correct answers. The evaluator can use this to determine if the candidate meets the passing criteria.","

```

This script will read the candidate's submission and the answer key, compare the values, and count the number of correct answers. The evaluator can use this to determine if the candidate meets the passing criteria. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","Below is the Python script named `task_evaluation.py` that reads the candidate's submission and the answer key, evaluates the performance, and saves the results in a JSON file named `test_results.json`.

```python
import json

def evaluate_submission(submission_file, answer_key_file, result_file):
    with open(submission_file, 'r') as sub_file, open(answer_key_file, 'r') as ans_file:
        submission = json.load(sub_file)

### Explanation of the Script

1. **File Reading**: The script reads the candidate's submission and the answer key from JSON files.

2. **Evaluation Process**:
   - It iterates over each task and product in the answer key.
   - For each product, it checks the candidate's submitted values against the correct values.
   - It records whether each answer is correct and keeps a count of correct answers.

3. **Results Compilation**:
   - The script compiles detailed results for each product, indicating the candidate's value, the correct value, and whether the answer was correct.
   - It calculates the overall score as a percentage of correct answers out of the total possible answers.

4. **Output**:
   - The results, including the overall score, are saved to a JSON file named `test_results.json`.
   - The script prints a confirmation message once the evaluation is complete.

This script provides a comprehensive evaluation of the candidate's performance and outputs the results in a structured format for easy review."

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","To create the `task_evaluation.py` script, we need to design a program that reads the candidate's submission and the answer key, evaluates the submission based on the criteria provided, and outputs the results in a structured JSON format. Below is the Python script that accomplishes this task:

```python
import json
import re

def load_json(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

def validate_task_1(submission, answer_key):
    # Check if the link is present and matches the expected format
    link = submission.get(""purchase_order_link"", """")
    if link.startswith(""https://"") and ""spreadsheet"" in link:
        return 1  # Full points for a valid link
    return 0  # No points if the link is invalid

def validate_task_2(submission, answer_key):
    # Check if the RFP text includes required sections
    rfp_text = submission.get(""rfp_text"", """")
    required_sections = [""service required"", ""evaluation criteria"", ""submission guidelines""]
    if all(section in rfp_text.lower() for section in required_sections):
        return 1  # Full points if all sections are present
    return 0  # No points if any section is missing

def validate_task_3(submission, answer_key):
    # Check if the summary identifies discrepancies
    summary = submission.get(""requisition_summary"", """")
    # For simplicity, assume we have a list of known discrepancies
    known_discrepancies = [""incorrect item codes"", ""missing quantities"", ""incomplete supplier details""]
    identified_discrepancies = [discrepancy for discrepancy in known_discrepancies if discrepancy in summary.lower()]
    if len(identified_discrepancies) / len(known_discrepancies) >= 0.8:
        return 1  # Full points if 80% or more discrepancies are identified
    return 0  # No points if less than 80% are identified

def evaluate_submission(submission, answer_key):
    results = {
        ""task_1"": validate_task_1(submission.get(""task_1"", {}), answer_key.get(""task_1"", {})),
        ""task_2"": validate_task_2(submission.get(""task_2"", {}), answer_key.get(""task_2"", {})),
        ""task_3"": validate_task_3(submission.get(""task_3"", {}), answer_key.get(""task_3"", {}))
    }
    overall_score = sum(results.values()) / len(results) * 100
    results[""overall_score""] = overall_score
    return results

def main():
    # Load the candidate's submission and the answer key
    submission = load_json('test_submission.json')
    answer_key = load_json('answer_key.json')

    # Evaluate the submission
    results = evaluate_submission(submission, answer_key)

    # Save the results to a JSON file
    with open('test_results.json', 'w') as file:
        json.dump(results, file, indent=4)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Script

1. **Loading JSON Files**: The script uses a helper function `load_json` to read JSON files, which is used to load both the candidate's submission and the answer key.

2. **Validation Functions**: Each task has a dedicated validation function:
   - `validate_task_1` checks if the purchase order link is valid.
   - `validate_task_2` checks if the RFP text includes all required sections.
   - `validate_task_3` checks if the summary identifies at least 80% of known discrepancies.

3. **Evaluation**: The `evaluate_submission` function calculates the score for each task and computes the overall score as a percentage.

4. **Output**: The results, including the overall score, are saved to `test_results.json`.

This script provides a structured and automated way to evaluate the candidate's performance based on the provided criteria."

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","To create the `task_evaluation.py` script, we need to implement a program that reads the candidate's submission and the answer key, evaluates the responses, and then outputs the results in a structured JSON format. Below is the Python script that accomplishes this task:

```python
import json

def load_json(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

def evaluate_task_1(candidate_response, answer_key):
    score = 0
    max_score = 2  # 1 point for correct supplier, 1 point for justification

    # Check if the selected supplier is correct
    if candidate_response.get(""selected_supplier"") == answer_key.get(""selected_supplier""):
        score += 1

    # Check if the justification is reasonable
    if candidate_response.get(""justification"") and ""quality"" in candidate_response[""justification""].lower() and ""price"" in candidate_response[""justification""].lower() and ""quantity"" in candidate_response[""justification""].lower():
        score += 1

    return score, max_score

def evaluate_task_2(candidate_response, answer_key):
    score = 0
    max_score = 2  # 1 point for proposing a discount, 1 point for logical arguments

    # Check if the email proposes a discount
    if ""discount"" in candidate_response.get(""negotiation_email"", """").lower():
        score += 1

    # Check if the email contains logical arguments
    if any(keyword in candidate_response.get(""negotiation_email"", """").lower() for keyword in [""market conditions"", ""partnership"", ""industry standards""]):
        score += 1

    return score, max_score

def main():
    # Load the candidate's submission and the answer key
    candidate_submission = load_json('test_submission.json')
    answer_key = load_json('answer_key.json')

    # Evaluate Task 1
    task_1_score, task_1_max_score = evaluate_task_1(candidate_submission.get(""task_1"", {}), answer_key.get(""task_1"", {}))

    # Evaluate Task 2
    task_2_score, task_2_max_score = evaluate_task_2(candidate_submission.get(""task_2"", {}), answer_key.get(""task_2"", {}))

    # Calculate overall score
    total_score = task_1_score + task_2_score
    total_max_score = task_1_max_score + task_2_max_score
    overall_score = (total_score / total_max_score) * 100

        ""task_2_max_score"": task_2_max_score,
        ""overall_score"": overall_score
    }

    # Save the results to a JSON file
    with open('test_results.json', 'w') as result_file:
        json.dump(results, result_file, indent=4)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Script

1. **Loading JSON Files**: The `load_json` function reads a JSON file and returns its content as a Python dictionary.

2. **Task Evaluation Functions**:
   - `evaluate_task_1`: This function checks if the candidate selected the correct supplier and provided a justification that includes references to quality, price, and quantity.
   - `evaluate_task_2`: This function checks if the candidate's email proposes a discount and includes logical arguments such as market conditions or partnership history.

3. **Main Function**:
   - Loads the candidate's submission and the answer key.
   - Evaluates each task and calculates the scores.
   - Computes the overall score as a percentage.
   - Saves the results in a JSON file named `test_results.json`.

This script provides a structured way to evaluate the candidate's performance and outputs the results in a format that is easy to interpret."

    ""recommendation"": ""Proceed with the supplier as they demonstrate financial stability.""
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

**Task 1: Price Proposal Analysis**

- **Discrepancies:** The candidate should identify any inconsistencies between the provided price proposal and industry benchmarks or historical data. For example, if the unit price of an item is significantly higher than the benchmark, it should be noted as a discrepancy. Similarly, if the total cost calculation does not align with the sum of unit prices and quantities, it should be flagged.

- **Total Cost:** The candidate should calculate the total cost of the proposal using a spreadsheet. This involves summing up the product of quantities and unit prices for all items.

- **Conclusion:** Based on the discrepancies and total cost analysis, the candidate should conclude whether the proposal is reasonable. A reasonable proposal would have minimal discrepancies and align with industry standards.

**Task 2: Financial Report Analysis**

- **Financial Ratios:** The candidate should calculate key financial ratios such as the profit margin and current ratio. The profit margin is calculated as (Net Income / Revenue) * 100, and the current ratio is calculated as Current Assets / Current Liabilities.

- **Financial Health:** The candidate should interpret the calculated ratios to assess the supplier's financial health. A healthy profit margin and a current ratio above 1 indicate financial stability.

- **Recommendation:** Based on the financial health assessment, the candidate should recommend whether to proceed with the supplier. A positive recommendation would be based on strong financial indicators.

### Passing Criteria

To pass the basic exam, the candidate must:

- Correctly identify at least one major discrepancy in Task 1.
- Accurately calculate the total cost in Task 1.
- Provide a reasonable conclusion based on the analysis in Task 1.
- Correctly calculate both financial ratios in Task 2.
- Provide a sound interpretation of the supplier's financial health in Task 2.
- Make a justified recommendation based on the financial analysis in Task 2.

### Validation of Answers

To programmatically validate the answers, the following checks can be implemented:

- **Discrepancies:** Check if the identified discrepancies match known issues in the provided data (e.g., unit price deviations, incorrect total cost calculations).

- **Total Cost:** Verify the calculated total cost against the expected value derived from the provided data.

- **Financial Ratios:** Validate the calculated profit margin and current ratio against expected values based on the financial report data.

- **Conclusion and Recommendation:** Use keyword matching to ensure the candidate's conclusions and recommendations align with the expected analysis outcomes.

These checks can be implemented using a script that compares the candidate's JSON submission against the answer key and expected outcomes.","

   - It checks each field (`name`, `reputation`, `history`, `reviews`, `additional_info` for updated suppliers and `name`, `score`, `rank` for evaluated suppliers) for correctness.
   - It counts the total number of fields and the number of correctly matched fields.

3. **Scoring:**
   - The overall score is calculated as the percentage of correctly matched fields out of the total fields.

4. **Output:**
   - The results, including detailed field correctness for each supplier and the overall score, are saved to `test_results.json`.

This script provides a structured approach to evaluating the candidate's ability to research and evaluate suppliers, ensuring that the evaluation is consistent and objective."

### Explanation of Correct Answers

1. **Task 1: Data Analysis and Interpretation**
   - **High Demand Products:** Identified by analyzing sales data to find products with consistently high sales volumes.
   - **Seasonal Variations:** Determined by observing sales spikes during specific months for each product.
   - **Inventory Turnover Rates:** Calculated using the formula: `Turnover Rate = Total Sales / Average Inventory`. This measures how often inventory is sold and replaced over a period.
   - **Potential Issues:** Highlighted based on data analysis, such as low stock levels or significant seasonal demand that could lead to stockouts.

2. **Task 2: Strategic Purchasing Plan Development**
   - **Actions:** Each action is tailored to address specific findings from Task 1, such as increasing order frequency for high-demand periods or monitoring stock levels for products with low inventory.
   - **Overall Strategy:** A concise summary of the approach to optimize purchasing and inventory management based on the analysis.

### Passing Criteria

- **Task 1:** At least 3 out of 4 components (high demand products, seasonal variations, inventory turnover rates, potential issues) must be correctly identified and justified.
- **Task 2:** At least 2 out of 3 actions must be relevant and justified based on Task 1 findings, and the overall strategy should logically align with the actions.

### Validation Approach

To programmatically validate answers, a script can be used to check:

1. **Correctness of JSON Structure:** Ensure the JSON file is well-formed and follows the specified structure.
2. **Content Validation:**
   - **Task 1:** Compare the candidate's answers with the answer key for high demand products, seasonal variations, and inventory turnover rates. Allow for slight variations in turnover rates due to rounding.
   - **Task 2:** Check if the actions and justifications align with the identified issues and trends from Task 1. Use keyword matching and logical checks to ensure relevance.

This approach ensures that the candidate's understanding and application of data analysis and strategic planning are accurately assessed.","

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","Below is the Python script named `task_evaluation.py` that reads the candidate's submission from `test_submission.json` and the answer key from `answer_key.json`. It evaluates the submission, calculates the score, and saves the results in `test_results.json`.

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","Below is a Python script named `task_evaluation.py` that reads the candidate's submission from `test_submission.json` and the answer key from `answer_key.json`. It evaluates the candidate's performance based on the provided criteria and saves the results in `test_results.json`.

```python
import json

def load_json(file_name):

    # Evaluate Trends
    if ""Trends"" in candidate and candidate[""Trends""]:
        if any(term in candidate[""Trends""].lower() for term in [""increase"", ""decrease"", ""rise"", ""fall"", ""spike"", ""drop""]):
            score += 1

```

### Explanation:
- **Loading JSON Files:** The script uses a helper function `load_json` to read JSON files.
- **Evaluation Functions:** Two functions, `evaluate_task_1` and `evaluate_task_2`, are used to score each task based on the presence of key terms and the number of sources.
- **Scoring Logic:** Each task has a maximum score of 2 points. The script checks for key terms in the candidate's responses to determine if they have identified trends, anomalies, and relevant factors.
- **Overall Score Calculation:** The overall score is calculated as a percentage of the total possible points.
- **Output:** The results are saved in `test_results.json`, including detailed scores for each task and the overall score.

This script provides a basic automated evaluation of the candidate's submission based on the criteria outlined in the exam overview. Adjustments can be made to the scoring logic to better fit specific evaluation needs."

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","To create the `task_evaluation.py` script, we need to design a program that reads the candidate's submission and the answer key, compares them, and calculates the score based on the criteria provided. Here's how the script can be structured:

```python

    """"""Load JSON data from a file.""""""
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

    """"""Calculate the score for Task 1.""""""
    candidate_items = candidate_data['task_1']['items']
    answer_items = answer_key['task_1']['items']
    
    correct_items = 0
    for candidate_item, answer_item in zip(candidate_items, answer_items):
        if candidate_item['duty_payable'] == answer_item['duty_payable']:
            correct_items += 1
    
    total_items = len(answer_items)
    item_score = (correct_items / total_items) * 100

    total_fields = 4  # service_provider, quote_amount, currency, confirmation_number
    
    for field in ['service_provider', 'quote_amount', 'currency', 'confirmation_number']:
        if candidate_quote[field] == answer_quote[field]:
            correct_fields += 1
    
    task_2_score = (correct_fields / total_fields) * 100

### Explanation of the Script

1. **Loading JSON Data**: The `load_json` function reads JSON data from a file, which is used to load both the candidate's submission and the answer key.

2. **Task 1 Scoring**: The `calculate_task_1_score` function compares each item's `duty_payable` value and checks the `total_duty`. It calculates the score based on the percentage of correct items and whether the total duty is correct.

3. **Task 2 Scoring**: The `calculate_task_2_score` function checks each field in the freight quote against the answer key and calculates the score based on the percentage of correct fields.

4. **Overall Score Calculation**: The overall score is the average of the scores from Task 1 and Task 2.

5. **Saving Results**: The results, including the scores for each task and the overall score, are saved to a JSON file named `test_results.json`.

This script provides a structured way to evaluate the candidate's performance based on the provided criteria and ensures that the results are saved in a clear and accessible format."

## Your assignment:
- If the exam doesn't require any additional material, just respond with ""No material required"".
- Else create synthetic test materials (CSV contents, datasets, etc.) that have predictable outcomes. Include the actual content to be provided to candidates and ensure all materials have clear identifiers, labels, or pre-defined categories that prevent ambiguity.

IMPORTANT: When designing the test, eliminate any opportunities for candidates to make arbitrary choices (like custom account codes, naming conventions, or classification systems) that would complicate evaluation. Either:
- Provide pre-defined structures/codes that must be used, or
- Design questions with objectively verifiable numerical/text answers that don't depend on the candidate's approach

  }
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

#### Task 1: Claims Form Verification

- **Policy Number Discrepancy:** The policy number provided in the claims form does not match the claimant's name in the records. This is a critical discrepancy as it could indicate a mismatch in the policyholder's identity.
- **Address Discrepancy:** The address is missing the postal code, which is essential for accurate identification and correspondence.
- **Contact Number Discrepancy:** The contact number format is incorrect. The expected format is (XXX) XXX-XXXX, which is a standard format for phone numbers in many regions.

#### Task 2: Insurance Coverage Determination

- **Coverage Determination:** The claim is covered because:
  - The incident type ""Theft"" is listed under covered incidents in the policy terms.
  - The amount claimed ($2,500) is within the policy limit and does not exceed the $5,000 threshold that requires prior approval.
  - The claim was reported on 2023-09-15, which is within 30 days of the incident date (2023-09-10), meeting the reporting requirement.

### Passing Criteria

To pass the basic exam, the candidate must:

- Correctly identify all discrepancies in Task 1.
- Accurately determine the coverage status in Task 2 and provide a valid justification.

A candidate must achieve 100% accuracy in identifying discrepancies and coverage determination to pass, as these tasks are critical to the role of a Claims Adjuster, Examiner, and Investigator.

### Validation of Answers

To programmatically validate the answers, the following checks can be implemented:

1. **Task 1 Validation:**
   - Ensure the JSON object contains exactly three discrepancies.
   - Validate that each discrepancy matches the expected field name and issue description.

2. **Task 2 Validation:**
   - Check that the `is_covered` field is a boolean and matches the expected value (`true`).
   - Verify that the `justification` field contains the required elements: mention of the incident type, amount claimed, and reporting timeframe.

By implementing these checks, the evaluator can ensure that the candidate's submission meets the required standards for accuracy and completeness.","

  }
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

#### Task 1: Claims Form Verification

- **Policy Number Discrepancy:** The policy number provided in the claims form does not match the claimant's name in the records. This is a critical discrepancy as it could indicate a mismatch in the policyholder's identity.
- **Address Discrepancy:** The address is missing the postal code, which is essential for accurate identification and correspondence.
- **Contact Number Discrepancy:** The contact number format is incorrect. The expected format is (XXX) XXX-XXXX, which is a standard format for phone numbers in many regions.

#### Task 2: Insurance Coverage Determination

- **Coverage Determination:** The claim is covered because:
  - The incident type ""Theft"" is listed under covered incidents in the policy terms.
  - The amount claimed ($2,500) is within the policy limit and does not exceed the $5,000 threshold that requires prior approval.
  - The claim was reported on 2023-09-15, which is within 30 days of the incident date (2023-09-10), meeting the reporting requirement.

### Passing Criteria

To pass the basic exam, the candidate must:

- Correctly identify all discrepancies in Task 1.
- Accurately determine the coverage status in Task 2 and provide a valid justification.

A candidate must achieve 100% accuracy in identifying discrepancies and coverage determination to pass, as these tasks are critical to the role of a Claims Adjuster, Examiner, and Investigator.

### Validation of Answers

To programmatically validate the answers, the following checks can be implemented:

1. **Task 1 Validation:**
   - Ensure the JSON object contains exactly three discrepancies.
   - Validate that each discrepancy matches the expected field name and issue description.

2. **Task 2 Validation:**
   - Check that the `is_covered` field is a boolean and matches the expected value (`true`).
   - Verify that the `justification` field contains the required elements: mention of the incident type, amount claimed, and reporting timeframe.

By implementing these checks, the evaluator can ensure that the candidate's submission meets the required standards for accuracy and completeness. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","Below is a Python script named `task_evaluation.py` that reads the candidate's submission from `test_submission.json` and the answer key from `answer_key.json`. It then evaluates the candidate's performance and saves the results in `test_results.json`.

### Explanation:
- **Loading JSON Files:** The script loads the candidate's submission and the answer key using the `load_json` function.
- **Task 1 Evaluation:** The script compares each discrepancy in the candidate's submission with the answer key. It counts the number of correct discrepancies and provides detailed results for each field.
- **Task 2 Evaluation:** The script checks if the `is_covered` and `justification` fields match the answer key.
- **Overall Score Calculation:** The script calculates the overall score as a percentage of correct answers out of the total possible correct answers.
- **Results Output:** The script saves the detailed results and overall score in `test_results.json`.

This script assumes that the `test_submission.json` and `answer_key.json` files are correctly formatted and located in the same directory as `task_evaluation.py`."

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this basic practical exam is to assess the candidate's ability to accurately pay and process claims within their designated authority level. This involves evaluating their skills in reviewing claim documents, verifying information, calculating claim amounts, and making decisions based on predefined authority limits. The exam is designed to simulate real-world scenarios that a Claims Adjuster, Examiner, or Investigator might encounter, ensuring they can effectively handle claims processing tasks using available digital tools.

**Structure:**
The exam is divided into two main tasks, each designed to test specific aspects of the claims processing workflow. The candidate will be provided with digital materials and will be required to submit their answers in a structured JSON format.

**Task 1: Document Review and Verification**
- **Objective:** Assess the candidate's ability to review and verify claim documents.
- **Materials Provided:** A PDF file containing a set of claim documents, including policy details, claim forms, and supporting evidence.
- **Instructions:** The candidate must review the documents and identify any discrepancies or missing information. They should list these issues in the JSON submission.

**Task 2: Claim Calculation and Decision Making**
- **Objective:** Evaluate the candidate's ability to calculate claim amounts and make decisions within their authority level.
- **Materials Provided:** A spreadsheet containing claim data, including policy limits, claimed amounts, and authority levels.
- **Instructions:** The candidate must calculate the payable amount for each claim, considering policy limits and authority levels. They should decide whether to approve or deny each claim and provide a brief justification for their decision in the JSON submission.

**Submission Format:**
The candidate must submit their answers in a JSON file named ""test_submission.json"". The JSON should include:
- A list of identified issues from Task 1.
- Calculated claim amounts, approval/denial decisions, and justifications for Task 2.

This structured approach ensures that the candidate demonstrates practical skills in claims processing, using the tools and materials provided. </examoverview>

### Your assignment:

Based on the explanation write clear, concise instructions for the candidate including:
- What they need to accomplish (without prescribing specific methods)
- Brief description of any materials that will be provided
- Expected format for answer submission
- The actual test they need perform, i.e. the tasks that need to be done or questions that need to be answered.

IMPORTANT: When designing the test, eliminate any opportunities for candidates to make arbitrary choices (like custom account codes, naming conventions, or classification systems) that would complicate evaluation. Either:
- Provide pre-defined structures/codes that must be used, or
- Design questions with objectively verifiable numerical/text answers that don't depend on the candidate's approach

```json
{
  ""candidate_id"": ""GPT-4-turbo"",
  ""document_issues"": [
    ""Missing signature on Claim Document 1"",
    ""Incorrect policy number on Claim Document 2"",
    ""Missing invoice for Claim Document 3""
  ],
  ""claim_decisions"": [
    {
      ""claim_id"": ""1001"",
      ""payable_amount"": 1500,
      ""decision"": ""approve"",
      ""justification"": ""Claim amount is within policy limits and authority level.""
    },
    {
      ""claim_id"": ""1002"",
      ""payable_amount"": 0,
      ""decision"": ""deny"",
      ""justification"": ""Claim amount exceeds policy limits.""
    },
    {
      ""claim_id"": ""1003"",
      ""payable_amount"": 500,
      ""decision"": ""approve"",
      ""justification"": ""Claim amount is within policy limits and authority level.""
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

#### Task 1: Document Review and Verification

1. **Missing signature on Claim Document 1**: The claim form in Document 1 is missing a signature on page 2, which is a necessary component for the document to be considered complete.

2. **Incorrect policy number on Claim Document 2**: The policy number listed in the claim form of Document 2 is incorrect. It should be 789012, but it is listed as 789021.

3. **Missing invoice for Claim Document 3**: Document 3 lacks an invoice for the claimed amount, which is required to verify the claim.

#### Task 2: Claim Calculation and Decision Making

1. **Claim ID 1001**: 
   - **Payable Amount**: 1500
   - **Decision**: Approve
   - **Justification**: The claimed amount of 1500 is within the policy limit of 2000 and the authority level of 2500.

2. **Claim ID 1002**: 
   - **Payable Amount**: 0
   - **Decision**: Deny
   - **Justification**: The claimed amount of 3000 exceeds the policy limit of 2500, thus it cannot be approved.

3. **Claim ID 1003**: 
   - **Payable Amount**: 500
   - **Decision**: Approve
   - **Justification**: The claimed amount of 500 is within the policy limit of 1000 and the authority level of 2500.

### Passing Criteria

To pass the exam, the candidate must:

- Correctly identify at least 2 out of 3 document issues.
- Correctly calculate and justify at least 2 out of 3 claim decisions.

### Validation Approach

To programmatically validate the answers, a script can be used to compare the candidate's JSON submission against the answer key. The script should:

1. Check if the `candidate_id` matches ""GPT-4-turbo"".
2. Compare each entry in the `document_issues` array with the expected issues. Allow for minor variations in wording but ensure the core issue is identified.
3. For each claim decision, verify:
   - The `claim_id` matches.
   - The `payable_amount` is correct.
   - The `decision` is correct.
   - The `justification` is logically consistent with the decision and the provided data.

A simple Python script could be used to automate this validation:

```python
import json

def validate_submission(submission, answer_key):
    # Check candidate ID
    if submission.get(""candidate_id"") != answer_key[""candidate_id""]:
        return False, ""Incorrect candidate ID""

    # Validate document issues
    correct_issues = set(answer_key[""document_issues""])
    submitted_issues = set(submission.get(""document_issues"", []))
    if len(correct_issues.intersection(submitted_issues)) < 2:
        return False, ""Insufficient correct document issues identified""

    # Validate claim decisions
    correct_decisions = answer_key[""claim_decisions""]
    submitted_decisions = submission.get(""claim_decisions"", [])
    correct_count = 0

    for correct_decision in correct_decisions:
        for submitted_decision in submitted_decisions:
            if (submitted_decision[""claim_id""] == correct_decision[""claim_id""] and
                submitted_decision[""payable_amount""] == correct_decision[""payable_amount""] and
                submitted_decision[""decision""] == correct_decision[""decision""]):
                correct_count += 1
                break

    if correct_count < 2:
        return False, ""Insufficient correct claim decisions""

    return True, ""Submission is valid""

    }
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

#### Task 1: Document Review and Verification

1. **Missing signature on Claim Document 1**: The claim form in Document 1 is missing a signature on page 2, which is a necessary component for the document to be considered complete.

2. **Incorrect policy number on Claim Document 2**: The policy number listed in the claim form of Document 2 is incorrect. It should be 789012, but it is listed as 789021.

3. **Missing invoice for Claim Document 3**: Document 3 lacks an invoice for the claimed amount, which is required to verify the claim.

#### Task 2: Claim Calculation and Decision Making

1. **Claim ID 1001**: 
   - **Payable Amount**: 1500
   - **Decision**: Approve
   - **Justification**: The claimed amount of 1500 is within the policy limit of 2000 and the authority level of 2500.

2. **Claim ID 1002**: 
   - **Payable Amount**: 0
   - **Decision**: Deny
   - **Justification**: The claimed amount of 3000 exceeds the policy limit of 2500, thus it cannot be approved.

3. **Claim ID 1003**: 
   - **Payable Amount**: 500
   - **Decision**: Approve
   - **Justification**: The claimed amount of 500 is within the policy limit of 1000 and the authority level of 2500.

### Passing Criteria

To pass the exam, the candidate must:

- Correctly identify at least 2 out of 3 document issues.
- Correctly calculate and justify at least 2 out of 3 claim decisions.

### Validation Approach

To programmatically validate the answers, a script can be used to compare the candidate's JSON submission against the answer key. The script should:

1. Check if the `candidate_id` matches ""GPT-4-turbo"".
2. Compare each entry in the `document_issues` array with the expected issues. Allow for minor variations in wording but ensure the core issue is identified.
3. For each claim decision, verify:
   - The `claim_id` matches.
   - The `payable_amount` is correct.
   - The `decision` is correct.
   - The `justification` is logically consistent with the decision and the provided data.

A simple Python script could be used to automate this validation:

```python
import json

def validate_submission(submission, answer_key):
    # Check candidate ID
    if submission.get(""candidate_id"") != answer_key[""candidate_id""]:
        return False, ""Incorrect candidate ID""

    # Validate document issues
    correct_issues = set(answer_key[""document_issues""])
    submitted_issues = set(submission.get(""document_issues"", []))
    if len(correct_issues.intersection(submitted_issues)) < 2:
        return False, ""Insufficient correct document issues identified""

    # Validate claim decisions
    correct_decisions = answer_key[""claim_decisions""]
    submitted_decisions = submission.get(""claim_decisions"", [])
    correct_count = 0

    for correct_decision in correct_decisions:
        for submitted_decision in submitted_decisions:
            if (submitted_decision[""claim_id""] == correct_decision[""claim_id""] and
                submitted_decision[""payable_amount""] == correct_decision[""payable_amount""] and
                submitted_decision[""decision""] == correct_decision[""decision""]):
                correct_count += 1
                break

    if correct_count < 2:
        return False, ""Insufficient correct claim decisions""

    return True, ""Submission is valid""

This script checks the candidate's submission against the answer key and provides feedback on whether the submission is valid based on the criteria outlined. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","Below is the Python script named `task_evaluation.py` that reads the candidate's submission from `test_submission.json` and the answer key from `answer_key.json`. It evaluates the candidate's performance and saves the results in `test_results.json`, including an overall score as a percentage.

```python
import json

def load_json(file_name):
    """"""Load JSON data from a file.""""""
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

def validate_submission(submission, answer_key):
    results = {
        ""document_issues"": [],
        ""claim_decisions"": [],
        ""overall_score"": 0
    }
    
    # Check candidate ID
    if submission.get(""candidate_id"") != answer_key[""candidate_id""]:
        results[""overall_score""] = 0
        return results

    # Validate document issues
    correct_issues = set(answer_key[""document_issues""])
    submitted_issues = set(submission.get(""document_issues"", []))

    results[""document_issues""] = list(correct_issues_identified)
    
    # Calculate document issues score
    document_issues_score = len(correct_issues_identified) / len(correct_issues) * 50  # 50% of total score
    results[""document_issues_score""] = document_issues_score

                submitted_decision[""decision""] == correct_decision[""decision""]):
                correct_count += 1
                decision_results.append(submitted_decision)
                break

    results[""claim_decisions""] = decision_results
    
    # Calculate claim decisions score
    claim_decisions_score = correct_count / len(correct_decisions) * 50  # 50% of total score

def main():
    # Load the submission and answer key
    submission = load_json('test_submission.json')
    answer_key = load_json('answer_key.json')

    # Validate the submission
    results = validate_submission(submission, answer_key)

    # Save the results
    save_results(results, 'test_results.json')

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
- **Loading JSON Files:** The script uses a helper function `load_json` to read JSON data from files.
- **Validation Logic:** The `validate_submission` function compares the candidate's submission against the answer key. It calculates scores for document issues and claim decisions, each contributing 50% to the overall score.
- **Scoring:** The script calculates the percentage of correct document issues and claim decisions, then combines these to form an overall score.
- **Saving Results:** The results, including detailed scores and the overall score, are saved to `test_results.json`.

### Usage:
1. Place `task_evaluation.py`, `test_submission.json`, and `answer_key.json` in the same directory.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
3. The results will be saved in `test_results.json` in the same directory."

- Explanation of correct answers and how they were derived
- Passing criteria (e.g., minimum number of correct answers)
- If there are multiple valid solution approaches, provide a way to programmatically validate answers (e.g., a validation formula or script)
","### Answer Key for Automated Checking

Below is a sample answer key in JSON format for automated checking. This key assumes hypothetical data and guidelines, as no specific data or guidelines were provided.

```json
{
  ""task_1"": {
    ""issues"": [
      {
        ""claim_id"": ""10001"",
        ""issue"": ""Missing Data"",
        ""proposed_correction"": ""Contact claimant for missing policy number""
      },
      {
        ""claim_id"": ""10002"",
        ""issue"": ""Incorrect Data"",
        ""proposed_correction"": ""Verify claim amount with policy details""
      },
      {
        ""claim_id"": ""10003"",
        ""issue"": ""Duplicate Entry"",
        ""proposed_correction"": ""Remove duplicate entry""
      }
    ]
  },
  ""task_2"": {
    ""non_compliant_claims"": [
      {
        ""claim_id"": ""10004"",
        ""reason"": ""Exceeds Policy Limit""
      },
      {
        ""claim_id"": ""10005"",
        ""reason"": ""Invalid Claim Date""
      },
      {
        ""claim_id"": ""10006"",
        ""reason"": ""Unapproved Claim Type""
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers and How They Were Derived

1. **Task 1: Data Verification**
   - **Missing Data:** Claims missing critical information such as claimant name, policy number, or claim amount should be flagged. The proposed correction involves contacting the claimant or relevant department to obtain the missing information.
   - **Incorrect Data:** Claims with data that do not match the expected values (e.g., claim amount not aligning with policy details) should be verified against the original policy documents or other reliable sources.
   - **Duplicate Entry:** Claims that appear more than once in the dataset should be identified and the duplicates removed to prevent processing errors.

2. **Task 2: Claims Analysis**
   - **Exceeds Policy Limit:** Claims where the settlement amount is greater than the policy limit should be flagged. The candidate should verify the policy details to confirm the limit.
   - **Invalid Claim Date:** Claims with dates that fall outside the policy coverage period or are otherwise invalid should be identified. The candidate should check the policy's effective dates.
   - **Unapproved Claim Type:** Claims that do not fall under the approved types as per the company's guidelines should be flagged. The candidate should refer to the provided guidelines to determine approved claim types.

### Passing Criteria

- **Task 1:** At least 2 out of 3 issues correctly identified and corrected.
- **Task 2:** At least 2 out of 3 non-compliant claims correctly identified and explained.

### Programmatic Validation of Answers

To programmatically validate the answers, a script can be used to compare the candidate's JSON submission against the answer key. The script should check for:

- Correct identification of issues and non-compliant claims.
- Correct use of pre-defined categories and reasons.
- Correct format and structure of the JSON file.

Here is a simple Python script outline for validation:

```python
import json

def validate_submission(candidate_file, answer_key_file):
    with open(candidate_file, 'r') as f:
        candidate_data = json.load(f)
    
    with open(answer_key_file, 'r') as f:
        answer_key = json.load(f)
    
    # Validate Task 1
    task_1_correct = 0
    for issue in candidate_data['task_1']['issues']:
        for correct_issue in answer_key['task_1']['issues']:
            if issue['claim_id'] == correct_issue['claim_id'] and issue['issue'] == correct_issue['issue']:
                task_1_correct += 1
                break
    
    # Validate Task 2
    task_2_correct = 0
    for claim in candidate_data['task_2']['non_compliant_claims']:
        for correct_claim in answer_key['task_2']['non_compliant_claims']:
            if claim['claim_id'] == correct_claim['claim_id'] and claim['reason'] == correct_claim['reason']:
                task_2_correct += 1
                break
    
    # Determine pass/fail
    task_1_pass = task_1_correct >= 2
    task_2_pass = task_2_correct >= 2
    
    return task_1_pass and task_2_pass

# Example usage
print(validate_submission('test_submission.json', 'answer_key.json'))
```

This script checks if the candidate's submission meets the passing criteria by comparing it to the answer key. Adjust the script as needed based on the actual data and guidelines provided.","

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers and How They Were Derived

1. **Task 1: Data Verification**
   - **Missing Data:** Claims missing critical information such as claimant name, policy number, or claim amount should be flagged. The proposed correction involves contacting the claimant or relevant department to obtain the missing information.
   - **Incorrect Data:** Claims with data that do not match the expected values (e.g., claim amount not aligning with policy details) should be verified against the original policy documents or other reliable sources.
   - **Duplicate Entry:** Claims that appear more than once in the dataset should be identified and the duplicates removed to prevent processing errors.

2. **Task 2: Claims Analysis**
   - **Exceeds Policy Limit:** Claims where the settlement amount is greater than the policy limit should be flagged. The candidate should verify the policy details to confirm the limit.
   - **Invalid Claim Date:** Claims with dates that fall outside the policy coverage period or are otherwise invalid should be identified. The candidate should check the policy's effective dates.
   - **Unapproved Claim Type:** Claims that do not fall under the approved types as per the company's guidelines should be flagged. The candidate should refer to the provided guidelines to determine approved claim types.

### Passing Criteria

- **Task 1:** At least 2 out of 3 issues correctly identified and corrected.
- **Task 2:** At least 2 out of 3 non-compliant claims correctly identified and explained.

### Programmatic Validation of Answers

To programmatically validate the answers, a script can be used to compare the candidate's JSON submission against the answer key. The script should check for:

- Correct identification of issues and non-compliant claims.
- Correct use of pre-defined categories and reasons.
- Correct format and structure of the JSON file.

Here is a simple Python script outline for validation:

```python
import json

def validate_submission(candidate_file, answer_key_file):
    with open(candidate_file, 'r') as f:
        candidate_data = json.load(f)
    
    with open(answer_key_file, 'r') as f:
        answer_key = json.load(f)
    
    # Validate Task 1
    task_1_correct = 0
    for issue in candidate_data['task_1']['issues']:
        for correct_issue in answer_key['task_1']['issues']:
            if issue['claim_id'] == correct_issue['claim_id'] and issue['issue'] == correct_issue['issue']:
                task_1_correct += 1
                break
    
    # Validate Task 2
    task_2_correct = 0
    for claim in candidate_data['task_2']['non_compliant_claims']:
        for correct_claim in answer_key['task_2']['non_compliant_claims']:
            if claim['claim_id'] == correct_claim['claim_id'] and claim['reason'] == correct_claim['reason']:
                task_2_correct += 1
                break
    
    # Determine pass/fail
    task_1_pass = task_1_correct >= 2
    task_2_pass = task_2_correct >= 2
    
    return task_1_pass and task_2_pass

# Example usage
print(validate_submission('test_submission.json', 'answer_key.json'))
```

This script checks if the candidate's submission meets the passing criteria by comparing it to the answer key. Adjust the script as needed based on the actual data and guidelines provided. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","Below is a Python script named `task_evaluation.py` that reads the candidate's submission from `test_submission.json` and the answer key from `answer_key.json`. It evaluates the candidate's performance and saves the results in `test_results.json`, including an overall score as a percentage.

## Your assignment:
- If the exam doesn't require any additional material, just respond with ""No material required"".
- Else create synthetic test materials (CSV contents, datasets, etc.) that have predictable outcomes. Include the actual content to be provided to candidates and ensure all materials have clear identifiers, labels, or pre-defined categories that prevent ambiguity.

IMPORTANT: When designing the test, eliminate any opportunities for candidates to make arbitrary choices (like custom account codes, naming conventions, or classification systems) that would complicate evaluation. Either:
- Provide pre-defined structures/codes that must be used, or
- Design questions with objectively verifiable numerical/text answers that don't depend on the candidate's approach

### Explanation of Correct Answers

1. **Task 1: Claim Analysis and Prioritization**
   - **Claim Prioritization:** The claims are prioritized based on severity, urgency, financial exposure, and potential legal implications. The justification should reflect an understanding of these factors.
   - **Justification:** Each claim's justification should clearly explain why it was assigned its priority level, considering the impact on the company and the claimant.

2. **Task 2: Resolution Strategy Development**
   - **Steps:** The steps should logically follow a process of gathering information, assessing the situation, and resolving the claim while ensuring compliance with company policies.
   - **Communication Strategy:** This should emphasize regular, clear communication with all parties involved to manage expectations and ensure transparency.
   - **Resource Allocation:** Efficient use of resources should be demonstrated by assigning appropriate personnel to handle different aspects of the claim.
   - **Potential Challenges:** Identifying potential challenges and proposing solutions shows foresight and problem-solving skills.

### Passing Criteria

- **Task 1:** At least 4 out of 5 claims must be correctly prioritized with appropriate justifications.
- **Task 2:** The resolution strategy must include at least 4 out of 5 correct steps, a coherent communication strategy, appropriate resource allocation, and identification of at least one potential challenge with a proposed solution.

### Validation of Answers

To programmatically validate answers, the evaluator can use the following approach:

1. **Task 1 Validation:**
   - Check if the claim IDs and priorities match the answer key.
   - Validate that justifications contain key phrases related to severity, urgency, financial exposure, and legal implications.

2. **Task 2 Validation:**
   - Ensure the steps include key actions such as document review, claimant contact, and settlement offer.
   - Verify that the communication strategy includes regular updates and transparency.
   - Check that resource allocation mentions specific roles or teams.
   - Confirm that potential challenges are realistic and have proposed solutions.

    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

1. **Task 1: Claim Analysis and Prioritization**
   - **Claim Prioritization:** The claims are prioritized based on severity, urgency, financial exposure, and potential legal implications. The justification should reflect an understanding of these factors.
   - **Justification:** Each claim's justification should clearly explain why it was assigned its priority level, considering the impact on the company and the claimant.

2. **Task 2: Resolution Strategy Development**
   - **Steps:** The steps should logically follow a process of gathering information, assessing the situation, and resolving the claim while ensuring compliance with company policies.
   - **Communication Strategy:** This should emphasize regular, clear communication with all parties involved to manage expectations and ensure transparency.
   - **Resource Allocation:** Efficient use of resources should be demonstrated by assigning appropriate personnel to handle different aspects of the claim.
   - **Potential Challenges:** Identifying potential challenges and proposing solutions shows foresight and problem-solving skills.

### Passing Criteria

- **Task 1:** At least 4 out of 5 claims must be correctly prioritized with appropriate justifications.
- **Task 2:** The resolution strategy must include at least 4 out of 5 correct steps, a coherent communication strategy, appropriate resource allocation, and identification of at least one potential challenge with a proposed solution.

### Validation of Answers

To programmatically validate answers, the evaluator can use the following approach:

1. **Task 1 Validation:**
   - Check if the claim IDs and priorities match the answer key.
   - Validate that justifications contain key phrases related to severity, urgency, financial exposure, and legal implications.

2. **Task 2 Validation:**
   - Ensure the steps include key actions such as document review, claimant contact, and settlement offer.
   - Verify that the communication strategy includes regular updates and transparency.
   - Check that resource allocation mentions specific roles or teams.
   - Confirm that potential challenges are realistic and have proposed solutions.

By using this structured approach, the evaluator can efficiently assess the candidate's ability to handle complex claims with a focus on service quality. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","To create the `task_evaluation.py` script, we need to design a program that reads the candidate's submission and the answer key, compares them, and calculates a score based on the criteria provided. Here's how you can implement this:

```python

        candidate_justification = candidate_claim['justification']

        # Find the corresponding claim in the answer key
        answer_claim = next((claim for claim in answer_key['task_1']['prioritization'] if claim['claim_id'] == claim_id), None)

        if answer_claim:
            is_priority_correct = candidate_priority == answer_claim['priority']
            is_justification_correct = all(keyword in candidate_justification for keyword in [""severity"", ""urgency"", ""financial"", ""legal""])

            if is_priority_correct and is_justification_correct:
                correct_count += 1

            detailed_results.append({

### Explanation:
- **Loading JSON Files:** The `load_json` function reads JSON data from a file.
- **Task 1 Evaluation:** The `evaluate_task_1` function checks if the candidate's prioritization and justifications match the answer key. It uses keywords to verify the justification.
- **Task 2 Evaluation:** The `evaluate_task_2` function checks the correctness of the steps, communication strategy, resource allocation, and potential challenges.
- **Scoring:** Each task is scored separately, and the overall score is the average of the two task scores.
- **Output:** The results are saved in `test_results.json`, including detailed results for each task and the overall score.

","### Answer Key for Automated Checking

Below is a sample answer key in JSON format for automated checking. This key assumes hypothetical data and scenarios, as the actual data and scenarios are not provided.

```json
{
  ""CandidateID"": ""GPT-4-turbo"",
  ""AdjustedReserves"": [
    {
      ""ClaimID"": ""12345"",
      ""AdjustedReserve"": 12000.00
    },
    {
      ""ClaimID"": ""67890"",
      ""AdjustedReserve"": 15000.00
    }
    // Additional adjusted claims here
  ],
  ""ReserveRecommendation"": {
    ""ScenarioID"": ""Scenario1"",
    ""Recommendation"": ""Increase reserve to 20000.00 due to potential litigation costs."",
    ""Justification"": ""Based on corporate policy section 3.2, potential litigation requires reserve adjustment.""
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers and How They Were Derived

1. **Task 1: Adjusted Reserves**
   - **ClaimID ""12345""**: The reserve was adjusted to 12000.00 based on the analysis of the claim data and the guidelines provided in the corporate policy. The adjustment might be due to factors such as increased claim amount, potential for additional costs, or changes in the claim's status.
   - **ClaimID ""67890""**: The reserve was adjusted to 15000.00 for similar reasons, ensuring alignment with corporate policy guidelines. The candidate should have identified these claims as requiring adjustments based on specific criteria outlined in the policy document.

2. **Task 2: Reserve Recommendation Report**
   - **ScenarioID ""Scenario1""**: The recommendation to increase the reserve to 20000.00 was made due to potential litigation costs. The justification references corporate policy section 3.2, which likely outlines conditions under which reserves should be adjusted for litigation risks. The candidate's task was to interpret the scenario and apply the policy correctly to make a justified recommendation.

### Passing Criteria

- **Task 1**: At least 80% of the claims requiring adjustments must be correctly identified and adjusted according to the corporate policy guidelines.
- **Task 2**: The reserve recommendation must be logically sound, with a clear justification referencing the appropriate sections of the corporate policy. The recommendation should align with the scenario details and demonstrate an understanding of reserve management principles.

### Validation of Answers

To programmatically validate the answers, the following approach can be used:

1. **Task 1 Validation**:
   - Compare each `ClaimID` and `AdjustedReserve` pair in the candidate's submission against the answer key.
   - Ensure that the `AdjustedReserve` values are within an acceptable range of the correct values (e.g., ±5% tolerance if applicable).

2. **Task 2 Validation**:
   - Check that the `ScenarioID` matches the expected scenario.
   - Validate that the `Recommendation` and `Justification` fields contain the correct reserve amount and reference the appropriate corporate policy sections.
   - Use keyword matching or semantic analysis to ensure the justification aligns with the policy guidelines.

### Example Validation Script (Pseudo-code)

```python
def validate_submission(submission, answer_key):
    # Validate Task 1
    correct_adjustments = 0
    for claim in submission[""AdjustedReserves""]:
        for correct_claim in answer_key[""AdjustedReserves""]:
            if claim[""ClaimID""] == correct_claim[""ClaimID""]:
                if abs(claim[""AdjustedReserve""] - correct_claim[""AdjustedReserve""]) <= 0.05 * correct_claim[""AdjustedReserve""]:
                    correct_adjustments += 1
                break

    task1_pass = correct_adjustments / len(answer_key[""AdjustedReserves""]) >= 0.8

    # Validate Task 2
    recommendation = submission[""ReserveRecommendation""]
    correct_recommendation = answer_key[""ReserveRecommendation""]

    task2_pass = (
        recommendation[""ScenarioID""] == correct_recommendation[""ScenarioID""] and
        recommendation[""Recommendation""] == correct_recommendation[""Recommendation""] and
        ""corporate policy section 3.2"" in recommendation[""Justification""]
    )

    return task1_pass and task2_pass

    }
  }
  ```
- Submit the JSON file as your final answer. </submission_requirements>
Here is the information given to the evaluator: <evaluation_information> ### Answer Key for Automated Checking

Below is a sample answer key in JSON format for automated checking. This key assumes hypothetical data and scenarios, as the actual data and scenarios are not provided.

```json
{
  ""CandidateID"": ""GPT-4-turbo"",
  ""AdjustedReserves"": [
    {
      ""ClaimID"": ""12345"",
      ""AdjustedReserve"": 12000.00
    },
    {
      ""ClaimID"": ""67890"",
      ""AdjustedReserve"": 15000.00
    }
    // Additional adjusted claims here
  ],
  ""ReserveRecommendation"": {
    ""ScenarioID"": ""Scenario1"",
    ""Recommendation"": ""Increase reserve to 20000.00 due to potential litigation costs."",
    ""Justification"": ""Based on corporate policy section 3.2, potential litigation requires reserve adjustment.""
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers and How They Were Derived

1. **Task 1: Adjusted Reserves**
   - **ClaimID ""12345""**: The reserve was adjusted to 12000.00 based on the analysis of the claim data and the guidelines provided in the corporate policy. The adjustment might be due to factors such as increased claim amount, potential for additional costs, or changes in the claim's status.
   - **ClaimID ""67890""**: The reserve was adjusted to 15000.00 for similar reasons, ensuring alignment with corporate policy guidelines. The candidate should have identified these claims as requiring adjustments based on specific criteria outlined in the policy document.

2. **Task 2: Reserve Recommendation Report**
   - **ScenarioID ""Scenario1""**: The recommendation to increase the reserve to 20000.00 was made due to potential litigation costs. The justification references corporate policy section 3.2, which likely outlines conditions under which reserves should be adjusted for litigation risks. The candidate's task was to interpret the scenario and apply the policy correctly to make a justified recommendation.

### Passing Criteria

- **Task 1**: At least 80% of the claims requiring adjustments must be correctly identified and adjusted according to the corporate policy guidelines.
- **Task 2**: The reserve recommendation must be logically sound, with a clear justification referencing the appropriate sections of the corporate policy. The recommendation should align with the scenario details and demonstrate an understanding of reserve management principles.

### Validation of Answers

To programmatically validate the answers, the following approach can be used:

1. **Task 1 Validation**:
   - Compare each `ClaimID` and `AdjustedReserve` pair in the candidate's submission against the answer key.
   - Ensure that the `AdjustedReserve` values are within an acceptable range of the correct values (e.g., ±5% tolerance if applicable).

2. **Task 2 Validation**:
   - Check that the `ScenarioID` matches the expected scenario.
   - Validate that the `Recommendation` and `Justification` fields contain the correct reserve amount and reference the appropriate corporate policy sections.
   - Use keyword matching or semantic analysis to ensure the justification aligns with the policy guidelines.

### Example Validation Script (Pseudo-code)

```python
def validate_submission(submission, answer_key):
    # Validate Task 1
    correct_adjustments = 0
    for claim in submission[""AdjustedReserves""]:
        for correct_claim in answer_key[""AdjustedReserves""]:

                if abs(claim[""AdjustedReserve""] - correct_claim[""AdjustedReserve""]) <= 0.05 * correct_claim[""AdjustedReserve""]:
                    correct_adjustments += 1
                break

    task1_pass = correct_adjustments / len(answer_key[""AdjustedReserves""]) >= 0.8

    # Validate Task 2
    recommendation = submission[""ReserveRecommendation""]
    correct_recommendation = answer_key[""ReserveRecommendation""]

    task2_pass = (
        recommendation[""ScenarioID""] == correct_recommendation[""ScenarioID""] and
        recommendation[""Recommendation""] == correct_recommendation[""Recommendation""] and

### Explanation:
- **Loading JSON Files:** The script uses a helper function `load_json` to read JSON data from files.
- **Task 1 Validation:** The function `validate_task1` checks each claim's adjusted reserve against the answer key, allowing a 5% tolerance.
- **Task 2 Validation:** The function `validate_task2` checks if the scenario ID, recommendation, and justification match the answer key.
- **Evaluation:** The `evaluate_submission` function calculates scores for each task and an overall score, assuming equal weight for both tasks.
- **Saving Results:** The `save_results` function writes the evaluation results to `test_results.json`.

This script will output a JSON file with detailed results and an overall score, providing a clear assessment of the candidate's performance."

### Passing Criteria

To pass the exam, the candidate must:
- Provide valid and accessible links to both the spreadsheet and text document.
- Accurately calculate and report the total number of claims, total settlement amount, and average settlement amount in Task 1.
- Provide a coherent and logical summary of their approach and any challenges faced in Task 2.

### Validation Approach

To programmatically validate the answers, the following checks can be implemented:

1. **Link Validation**: Ensure that the provided URLs are accessible and lead to the correct file types (spreadsheet for Task 1 and text document for Task 2).

2. **Data Validation for Task 1**:
   - Use a script to open the spreadsheet and verify the total number of claims matches the count of entries in the CSV file.
   - Verify the total settlement amount by summing the settlement amounts in the spreadsheet and comparing it to the provided value.
   - Calculate the average settlement amount from the spreadsheet data and compare it to the provided value.

3. **Content Validation for Task 2**:
   - Check that the text document contains an organized list of claims with additional notes or observations.
   - Ensure the notes section in the JSON file provides a logical explanation of the candidate's approach and any challenges faced.

By following these validation steps, evaluators can ensure that the candidate has demonstrated the necessary skills to maintain claim files effectively. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","To create the `task_evaluation.py` script, we need to design a program that reads the candidate's submission and the answer key, evaluates the submission based on the criteria provided, and outputs the results in a structured JSON format. Below is the Python script that accomplishes this task:

```python
import json
import os

def load_json(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

    candidate_summary = candidate_data['task_1']['summary']
    answer_summary = answer_key['task_1']['summary']
    
    total_claims_correct = candidate_summary['total_claims'] == answer_summary['total_claims']
    total_settlement_correct = candidate_summary['total_settlement_amount'] == answer_summary['total_settlement_amount']
    average_settlement_correct = candidate_summary['average_settlement_amount'] == answer_summary['average_settlement_amount']
    
    score = sum([total_claims_correct, total_settlement_correct, average_settlement_correct])
    return score, total_claims_correct, total_settlement_correct, average_settlement_correct

def evaluate_task_2(candidate_data, answer_key):
    # Placeholder for text document content validation
    # In a real-world scenario, you would check the content of the text document
    notes_correct = candidate_data['task_2']['notes'] == answer_key['task_2']['notes']
    
    score = 1 if notes_correct else 0
    return score, notes_correct

def main():
    candidate_file = 'test_submission.json'
    answer_key_file = 'answer_key.json'
    
    if not os.path.exists(candidate_file) or not os.path.exists(answer_key_file):
        print(""Required files are missing."")
        return
    
    candidate_data = load_json(candidate_file)
    answer_key = load_json(answer_key_file)
    
    # Validate links
    links_valid = validate_links(candidate_data)
    
    # Evaluate Task 1
    task_1_score, total_claims_correct, total_settlement_correct, average_settlement_correct = evaluate_task_1(candidate_data, answer_key)

    # Calculate overall score
    total_possible_score = 4  # 3 for Task 1 and 1 for Task 2
    overall_score = ((task_1_score + task_2_score) / total_possible_score) * 100
    
    # Prepare results
    results = {
        ""task_1"": {
            ""total_claims_correct"": total_claims_correct,
            ""total_settlement_correct"": total_settlement_correct,
            ""average_settlement_correct"": average_settlement_correct,

    print(""Evaluation complete. Results saved to 'test_results.json'."")

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Script:

1. **Loading JSON Files**: The script reads the candidate's submission and the answer key from JSON files.

2. **Link Validation**: A placeholder function `validate_links` is included to simulate link validation. In a real-world scenario, this would involve checking if the URLs are accessible.

3. **Task 1 Evaluation**: The script compares the candidate's summary data (total claims, total settlement amount, and average settlement amount) with the answer key. It assigns a score based on the correctness of each component.

4. **Task 2 Evaluation**: The script checks if the candidate's notes match the expected notes in the answer key. This is a placeholder for more complex text analysis.

5. **Overall Score Calculation**: The script calculates the overall score as a percentage of the total possible points.

6. **Results Output**: The results, including detailed task evaluations and the overall score, are saved to a JSON file named `test_results.json`.

This script provides a basic framework for evaluating the candidate's submission against the provided answer key. Adjustments may be needed for more complex validation scenarios, such as actual content verification of linked documents."

- Explanation of correct answers and how they were derived
- Passing criteria (e.g., minimum number of correct answers)
- If there are multiple valid solution approaches, provide a way to programmatically validate answers (e.g., a validation formula or script)
","To create a comprehensive answer key and evaluation criteria for the basic practical exam, we need to ensure that the evaluator can effectively assess the candidate's ability to identify and refer questionable claims. Below is the detailed answer key, explanation, passing criteria, and validation approach.

### Answer Key in JSON Format

The answer key will be based on a hypothetical dataset and SOP. Since no specific data is provided, I'll create a sample answer key that can be adapted to the actual dataset used in the exam.

```json
{
  ""candidate_id"": ""GPT-4-turbo"",
  ""questionable_claims"": [
    {
      ""claim_id"": ""001"",
      ""explanation"": ""Claim amount is significantly higher than average for similar incidents.""
    },
    {
      ""claim_id"": ""002"",
      ""explanation"": ""Claimant information does not match previous records.""
    }
  ],
  ""referral_email"": ""Dear Investigator, \n\nI am writing to refer claim ID 001 for further investigation. The claim amount is significantly higher than average for similar incidents, which raises concerns about its validity. Please review the attached documentation and proceed as necessary.\n\nThank you,\n[Your Name]""
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

1. **Questionable Claims:**
   - **Claim ID 001:** The claim amount is flagged as questionable because it is significantly higher than the average for similar incidents. This could indicate potential fraud or an error in the claim.
   - **Claim ID 002:** The claimant information does not match previous records, suggesting possible identity fraud or clerical error.

2. **Referral Email:**
   - The email should clearly state the claim ID and the reason for referral. It should follow the format provided in the SOP, ensuring all necessary details are included for the investigator to proceed.

### Passing Criteria

- **Identification of Questionable Claims:** The candidate must correctly identify at least 2 out of 3 questionable claims in the dataset. Each claim should have a valid explanation based on the data provided.
- **Referral Email:** The email must include the correct claim ID, a clear explanation for the referral, and adhere to the SOP format.

### Validation Approach

To programmatically validate the candidate's submission, the following checks can be implemented:

1. **JSON Structure Validation:**
   - Ensure the JSON file is correctly formatted and includes all required fields: `candidate_id`, `questionable_claims`, and `referral_email`.

2. **Claim Identification Validation:**
   - Compare the `claim_id` and `explanation` fields in the candidate's submission against the answer key.
   - Use a script to check if the explanations provided are relevant to the data anomalies in the dataset.

3. **Email Content Validation:**
   - Verify that the `referral_email` includes the correct claim ID and explanation.
   - Check for adherence to the SOP format, including necessary details and professional tone.

### Example Validation Script (Pseudo-code)

```python
def validate_submission(submission, answer_key):
    # Check JSON structure
    required_fields = [""candidate_id"", ""questionable_claims"", ""referral_email""]
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in submission:

    # Validate questionable claims
    correct_claims = 0
    for claim in submission[""questionable_claims""]:
        for answer in answer_key[""questionable_claims""]:
            if claim[""claim_id""] == answer[""claim_id""] and claim[""explanation""] == answer[""explanation""]:
                correct_claims += 1

    # Validate referral email
    email_valid = submission[""referral_email""] == answer_key[""referral_email""]

    # Determine pass/fail
    if correct_claims >= 2 and email_valid:
        return True, ""Pass""
    else:
        return False, ""Fail""

Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","To create the `task_evaluation.py` script, we need to ensure it reads the candidate's submission and the answer key, evaluates the submission based on the criteria provided, and outputs the results in a structured JSON format. Below is the Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import json

def load_json(file_path):
    """"""Load JSON data from a file.""""""
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

def validate_submission(submission, answer_key):
    """"""Validate the candidate's submission against the answer key.""""""
    results = {
        ""candidate_id"": submission.get(""candidate_id"", ""Unknown""),
        ""questionable_claims_correct"": 0,
        ""total_questionable_claims"": len(answer_key[""questionable_claims""]),
        ""referral_email_correct"": False,
        ""overall_score"": 0
    }

    # Validate questionable claims
    for claim in submission.get(""questionable_claims"", []):
        for answer in answer_key[""questionable_claims""]:
            if claim[""claim_id""] == answer[""claim_id""] and claim[""explanation""] == answer[""explanation""]:
                results[""questionable_claims_correct""] += 1

    # Validate referral email
    if submission.get(""referral_email"") == answer_key.get(""referral_email""):
        results[""referral_email_correct""] = True

    # Calculate overall score
    claims_score = (results[""questionable_claims_correct""] / results[""total_questionable_claims""]) * 50
    email_score = 50 if results[""referral_email_correct""] else 0
    results[""overall_score""] = claims_score + email_score

    return results

def save_results(results, file_path):
    """"""Save the evaluation results to a JSON file.""""""
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        json.dump(results, file, indent=4)

def main():
    # Load the candidate's submission and the answer key
    submission = load_json('test_submission.json')
    answer_key = load_json('answer_key.json')

    # Validate the submission
    results = validate_submission(submission, answer_key)

    # Save the results
    save_results(results, 'test_results.json')

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Script

1. **Loading JSON Data:**
   - The `load_json` function reads a JSON file and returns its content as a Python dictionary.

2. **Validation Function:**
   - The `validate_submission` function compares the candidate's submission against the answer key.
   - It checks the number of correctly identified questionable claims and whether the referral email matches the expected format.
   - The overall score is calculated based on the number of correct claims (50% of the score) and the correctness of the referral email (50% of the score).

3. **Saving Results:**
   - The `save_results` function writes the evaluation results to a JSON file named `test_results.json`.

4. **Main Function:**
   - The `main` function orchestrates the loading of data, validation, and saving of results.

### Usage

- Place the `task_evaluation.py` script, `test_submission.json`, and `answer_key.json` in the same directory.
- Run the script using a Python interpreter. It will generate a `test_results.json` file containing the evaluation results and the overall score."

- Complete answer key in JSON format for automated checking
- Explanation of correct answers and how they were derived
- Passing criteria (e.g., minimum number of correct answers)
- If there are multiple valid solution approaches, provide a way to programmatically validate answers (e.g., a validation formula or script)
","### Answer Key for Automated Checking

The answer key is a JSON file that contains the expected discrepancies based on a hypothetical dataset. This will be used to automatically check the candidate's submission.

```json
{
  ""Candidate ID"": ""GPT-4-turbo"",
  ""Discrepancies"": [
    {
      ""Claim ID"": ""001"",
      ""Discrepancy Type"": ""Overpayment"",
      ""Explanation"": ""Paid amount exceeds claimed amount by $50.""
    },
    {
      ""Claim ID"": ""002"",
      ""Discrepancy Type"": ""Underpayment"",
      ""Explanation"": ""Paid amount is $30 less than claimed amount.""
    },
    {
      ""Claim ID"": ""003"",
      ""Discrepancy Type"": ""Other Irregularity"",
      ""Explanation"": ""Notes indicate potential duplicate claim.""
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers and How They Were Derived

1. **Overpayment Example:**
   - **Claim ID: 001**
   - **Discrepancy Type: Overpayment**
   - **Explanation:** The `Paid Amount` is greater than the `Claimed Amount` by $50. This is identified by calculating the difference between the `Paid Amount` and the `Claimed Amount` and checking if it is positive.

2. **Underpayment Example:**
   - **Claim ID: 002**
   - **Discrepancy Type: Underpayment**
   - **Explanation:** The `Paid Amount` is less than the `Claimed Amount` by $30. This is identified by calculating the difference between the `Claimed Amount` and the `Paid Amount` and checking if it is positive.

3. **Other Irregularity Example:**
   - **Claim ID: 003**
   - **Discrepancy Type: Other Irregularity**
   - **Explanation:** The `Notes` column contains information indicating a potential duplicate claim. This requires reading and interpreting the notes to identify any non-numeric discrepancies.

### Passing Criteria

- The candidate must correctly identify and report at least 2 out of the 3 discrepancies to pass the basic exam.
- Each discrepancy must be correctly categorized and explained in the JSON submission.

### Validation Formula or Script

To programmatically validate the candidate's answers, a script can be used to compare the candidate's JSON submission against the answer key. Here is a simple validation script in Python:

```python
import json

def validate_submission(candidate_file, answer_key_file):
    with open(candidate_file, 'r') as f:
        candidate_data = json.load(f)
    
    with open(answer_key_file, 'r') as f:
        answer_key_data = json.load(f)
    
    candidate_discrepancies = candidate_data.get(""Discrepancies"", [])
    answer_key_discrepancies = answer_key_data.get(""Discrepancies"", [])
    
    correct_count = 0
    
    for candidate_discrepancy in candidate_discrepancies:
        for answer_key_discrepancy in answer_key_discrepancies:
            if (candidate_discrepancy[""Claim ID""] == answer_key_discrepancy[""Claim ID""] and
                candidate_discrepancy[""Discrepancy Type""] == answer_key_discrepancy[""Discrepancy Type""] and
                candidate_discrepancy[""Explanation""] == answer_key_discrepancy[""Explanation""]):
                correct_count += 1
                break
    
    return correct_count >= 2

# Example usage
is_passed = validate_submission('test_submission.json', 'answer_key.json')
print(""Passed:"", is_passed)
```

This script checks if the candidate's submission contains at least two correctly identified discrepancies by comparing each entry in the candidate's JSON file with the entries in the answer key.","

    return correct_count >= 2

# Example usage
is_passed = validate_submission('test_submission.json', 'answer_key.json')
print(""Passed:"", is_passed)
```

This script checks if the candidate's submission contains at least two correctly identified discrepancies by comparing each entry in the candidate's JSON file with the entries in the answer key. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","Below is the Python script named `task_evaluation.py` that reads the candidate's submission and the answer key, evaluates the performance, and saves the results in a `test_results.json` file. The script calculates the overall score as a percentage of correctly identified discrepancies.

```python

### Explanation:
- **Loading Data**: The script reads the candidate's submission and the answer key from JSON files.
- **Evaluation**: It compares each discrepancy in the candidate's submission with the answer key. If a match is found, it increments the `correct_count`.
- **Detailed Results**: For each discrepancy in the candidate's submission, it records whether it was correct.
- **Overall Score**: The score is calculated as a percentage of correctly identified discrepancies out of the total discrepancies in the answer key.
- **Output**: The results, including detailed results and the overall score, are saved to `test_results.json`.

This script provides a comprehensive evaluation of the candidate's performance, allowing for both detailed analysis and a summary score."
