Your assignment is to determine if it is possible to design a meaningful, **practical** exam for this task that can be performed remotely and to identify the required tools and materials for the evaluation. 

**Definitions:**
- **Tools:** Software or applications (e.g., coding languages, code editor, spreadsheets, text editor, presentation software, image generator), that the candidate needs to use to complete the test.
- **Materials:** Digital content (e.g., data files, PDFs, images, audio files, virtual lab environments) that form part of the test content.
- **Practical exam:** A practical exam is a an exam actually testing whether the described task can be performed successfully. An exam testing the knowledge about the task is NOT a practical exam.

**Instructions:**
1. **Remote Feasibility:**  
   Evaluate whether the task can be performed online/remotely or if it requires in-person presence.
   - **If in-person required:** Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": false` and set all other fields (tools and materials) to `""NA""`.
   - **If remote:** Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": true` and continue with the evaluation.

2. **Tools Required:**  
   For each tool, assess whether it is needed for the task (Design, implement, or maintain fraud detection tools or procedures.) for the role of Fraud Examiners, Investigators and Analysts. Options are: ""Required"" or ""Not Required"". The tools include:
   - ""Coding""
   - ""Spreadsheets""
   - ""Text editor""
   - ""PDF viewer""
   - ""Presentation software""
   - ""Image Generator""
   - ""Web Browser""
   - ""Other"" (specify tool name and classification if needed; otherwise ""NA"")

3. **Materials Required:**  
   For each material, determine if it is necessary as part of the test to evaluate Fraud Examiners, Investigators and Analysts's ability to perform the task (Design, implement, or maintain fraud detection tools or procedures.). Options are: ""Required""or ""Not required"" The materials include:
   - ""Text""

   - ""Other"" (specify material name and classification if needed; otherwise ""NA"")

4. **Feasability of a practical exam:**
    Evaluate whether the task can meaningfuly be tested in a practical, remote exam.
    - If you think this is possible, answer True,
    - Otherwise answer False

5. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**  
   Optionally, include a brief chain-of-thought explanation (no more than 150 words) for your evaluations in a field called `""chain_of_thought""`.

**Output Requirement:**  
Return a JSON object strictly adhering to the provided structure, without any extra commentary outside of the JSON fields.
