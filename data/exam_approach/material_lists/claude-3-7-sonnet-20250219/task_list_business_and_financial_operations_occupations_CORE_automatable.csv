Your assignment is to determine if it is possible to design a meaningful, **practical** exam for this task that can be performed remotely and to identify the required tools and materials for the evaluation. 

**Definitions:**
- **Tools:** Software or applications (e.g., coding languages, code editor, spreadsheets, text editor, presentation software, image generator), that the candidate needs to use to complete the test.
- **Materials:** Digital content (e.g., data files, PDFs, images, audio files, virtual lab environments) that form part of the test content.
- **Practical exam:** A practical exam is a an exam actually testing whether the described task can be performed successfully. An exam testing the knowledge about the task is NOT a practical exam.

**Instructions:**
1. **Remote Feasibility:**  
   Evaluate whether the task can be performed online/remotely or if it requires in-person presence.
   - **If in-person required:** Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": false` and set all other fields (tools and materials) to `""NA""`.
   - **If remote:** Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": true` and continue with the evaluation.

   - ""PDF viewer""
   - ""Presentation software""
   - ""Image Generator""
   - ""Web Browser""
   - ""Other"" (specify tool name and classification if needed; otherwise ""NA"")

3. **Materials Required:**  
   For each material, determine if it is necessary as part of the test to evaluate Claims Adjusters, Examiners, and Investigators's ability to perform the task (Investigate, evaluate, and settle claims, applying technical knowledge and human relations skills to effect fair and prompt disposal of cases and to contribute to a reduced loss ratio.).

    - If you think this is possible, answer True,
    - Otherwise answer False

5. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**  
   Optionally, include a brief chain-of-thought explanation (no more than 150 words) for your evaluations in a field called `""chain_of_thought""`.

Your assignment is to determine if it is possible to design a meaningful, **practical** exam for this task that can be performed remotely and to identify the required tools and materials for the evaluation. 

**Definitions:**
- **Tools:** Software or applications (e.g., coding languages, code editor, spreadsheets, text editor, presentation software, image generator), that the candidate needs to use to complete the test.
- **Materials:** Digital content (e.g., data files, PDFs, images, audio files, virtual lab environments) that form part of the test content.

**Instructions:**
1. **Remote Feasibility:**  
   Evaluate whether the task can be performed online/remotely or if it requires in-person presence.
   - **If in-person required:** Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": false` and set all other fields (tools and materials) to `""NA""`.
   - **If remote:** Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": true` and continue with the evaluation.

Your assignment is to determine if it is possible to design a meaningful, **practical** exam for this task that can be performed remotely and to identify the required tools and materials for the evaluation. 

**Definitions:**
- **Tools:** Software or applications (e.g., coding languages, code editor, spreadsheets, text editor, presentation software, image generator), that the candidate needs to use to complete the test.
- **Materials:** Digital content (e.g., data files, PDFs, images, audio files, virtual lab environments) that form part of the test content.
- **Practical exam:** A practical exam is a an exam actually testing whether the described task can be performed successfully. An exam testing the knowledge about the task is NOT a practical exam.

**Instructions:**
1. **Remote Feasibility:**  
   Evaluate whether the task can be performed online/remotely or if it requires in-person presence.
   - **If in-person required:** Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": false` and set all other fields (tools and materials) to `""NA""`.
   - **If remote:** Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": true` and continue with the evaluation.

Your assignment is to determine if it is possible to design a meaningful, **practical** exam for this task that can be performed remotely and to identify the required tools and materials for the evaluation. 

**Definitions:**
- **Tools:** Software or applications (e.g., coding languages, code editor, spreadsheets, text editor, presentation software, image generator), that the candidate needs to use to complete the test.
- **Materials:** Digital content (e.g., data files, PDFs, images, audio files, virtual lab environments) that form part of the test content.

4. **Feasability of a practical exam:**
    Evaluate whether the task can meaningfuly be tested in a practical, remote exam.
    - If you think this is possible, answer True,
    - Otherwise answer False

5. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**  
   Optionally, include a brief chain-of-thought explanation (no more than 150 words) for your evaluations in a field called `""chain_of_thought""`.
