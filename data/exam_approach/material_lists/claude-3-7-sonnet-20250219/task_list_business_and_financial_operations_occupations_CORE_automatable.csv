Your assignment is to determine if it is possible to design a meaningful, **practical** exam for this task that can be performed remotely and to identify the required tools and materials for the evaluation. 

**Definitions:**
- **Tools:** Software or applications (e.g., coding languages, code editor, spreadsheets, text editor, presentation software, image generator), that the candidate needs to use to complete the test.
- **Materials:** Digital content (e.g., data files, PDFs, images, audio files, virtual lab environments) that form part of the test content.
- **Practical exam:** A practical exam is a an exam actually testing whether the described task can be performed successfully. An exam testing the knowledge about the task is NOT a practical exam.

**Instructions:**
1. **Remote Feasibility:**  
   Evaluate whether the task can be performed online/remotely or if it requires in-person presence.
   - **If in-person required:** Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": false` and set all other fields (tools and materials) to `""NA""`.
   - **If remote:** Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": true` and continue with the evaluation.

2. **Tools Required:**  
   For each tool, assess whether it is needed for the task (Conduct research to identify the goals, net worth, charitable donation history, or other data related to potential donors, potential investors, or general donor markets.) for the role of Fundraisers.
