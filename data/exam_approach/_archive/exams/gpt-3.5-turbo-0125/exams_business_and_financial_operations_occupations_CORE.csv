}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

**Task 1: Contract Analysis and Fee Calculation**

- **Calculated Fees:** The correct total amount due is $1500.00. This is derived from a 10% commission on $15,000 earnings, as specified in the contract.
- **Summary:** The summary should clearly state the calculation method, such as ""Calculated 10% commission on $15,000 earnings.""

**Task 2: Payment Collection Simulation**

- **Payment Matching Results:** The payments received on ""2023-10-01"" and ""2023-10-05"" should be matched to the calculated fees. Both payments are correctly matched, totaling the calculated fees of $1500.00.
- **Discrepancies:** There are no discrepancies in this scenario as all payments match the calculated fees.

### Passing Criteria

To pass the exam, the candidate must:

1. Correctly calculate the total fees or commissions due in Task 1.
2. Provide an accurate summary of the calculations in Task 1.
3. Correctly match all payments to the calculated fees in Task 2.
4. Accurately document any discrepancies, if present, in Task 2.

A candidate must achieve at least 75% accuracy across both tasks to pass. This means they should correctly perform at least three out of the four criteria listed above.

### Programmatic Validation

To programmatically validate the candidate's answers, the evaluator can use the following checks:

1. **Task 1 Validation:**
   - Verify that `calculated_fees` is a number and matches the expected value (1500.00).
   - Check that the `summary` contains the correct calculation method and values.

2. **Task 2 Validation:**
   - Ensure each payment in `payment_matching_results` has a `status` of ""matched"" and the total matches `calculated_fees`.
   - Confirm that `discrepancies` is empty or correctly lists any unmatched payments or errors.

Here is a simple Python script to validate the JSON submission:

```python
import json

def validate_submission(submission):
    expected_fees = 1500.00
    expected_summary = ""Calculated 10% commission on $15,000 earnings.""
    expected_payments = [
        {""payment_date"": ""2023-10-01"", ""amount"": 500.00, ""status"": ""matched""},
        {""payment_date"": ""2023-10-05"", ""amount"": 1000.00, ""status"": ""matched""}
    ]

    # Load the submission
    with open(submission, 'r') as file:
        data = json.load(file)

    # Validate Task 1
    if data['task_1']['calculated_fees'] != expected_fees:
        return False
    if data['task_1']['summary'] != expected_summary:
        return False

    # Validate Task 2
    if data['task_2']['payment_matching_results'] != expected_payments:
        return False
    if data['task_2']['discrepancies']:
        return False

    return True

# Example usage
print(validate_submission('test_submission.json'))
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

**Task 1: Contract Analysis and Fee Calculation**

- **Calculated Fees:** The correct total amount due is $1500.00. This is derived from a 10% commission on $15,000 earnings, as specified in the contract.
- **Summary:** The summary should clearly state the calculation method, such as ""Calculated 10% commission on $15,000 earnings.""

**Task 2: Payment Collection Simulation**

- **Payment Matching Results:** The payments received on ""2023-10-01"" and ""2023-10-05"" should be matched to the calculated fees. Both payments are correctly matched, totaling the calculated fees of $1500.00.
- **Discrepancies:** There are no discrepancies in this scenario as all payments match the calculated fees.

### Passing Criteria

To pass the exam, the candidate must:

1. Correctly calculate the total fees or commissions due in Task 1.
2. Provide an accurate summary of the calculations in Task 1.
3. Correctly match all payments to the calculated fees in Task 2.
4. Accurately document any discrepancies, if present, in Task 2.

A candidate must achieve at least 75% accuracy across both tasks to pass. This means they should correctly perform at least three out of the four criteria listed above.

### Programmatic Validation

To programmatically validate the candidate's answers, the evaluator can use the following checks:

1. **Task 1 Validation:**
   - Verify that `calculated_fees` is a number and matches the expected value (1500.00).
   - Check that the `summary` contains the correct calculation method and values.

2. **Task 2 Validation:**
   - Ensure each payment in `payment_matching_results` has a `status` of ""matched"" and the total matches `calculated_fees`.
   - Confirm that `discrepancies` is empty or correctly lists any unmatched payments or errors.

Here is a simple Python script to validate the JSON submission:

```python
import json

def validate_submission(submission):
    expected_fees = 1500.00
    expected_summary = ""Calculated 10% commission on $15,000 earnings.""
    expected_payments = [
        {""payment_date"": ""2023-10-01"", ""amount"": 500.00, ""status"": ""matched""},
        {""payment_date"": ""2023-10-05"", ""amount"": 1000.00, ""status"": ""matched""}
    ]

    # Load the submission
    with open(submission, 'r') as file:
        data = json.load(file)

    # Validate Task 1
    if data['task_1']['calculated_fees'] != expected_fees:
        return False
    if data['task_1']['summary'] != expected_summary:
        return False

    # Validate Task 2
    if data['task_2']['payment_matching_results'] != expected_payments:
        return False
    if data['task_2']['discrepancies']:
        return False

    return True

# Example usage
print(validate_submission('test_submission.json'))
```

This script checks the key elements of the JSON submission against the expected values and structure, ensuring that the candidate's answers are correct. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","To create the `task_evaluation.py` script, we will follow these steps:

1. Load the candidate's submission from `test_submission.json`.
2. Load the answer key from `answer_key.json`.
3. Compare the candidate's answers with the answer key.
4. Calculate the score based on the comparison.
5. Save the results and the overall score to `test_results.json`.

Here's the Python script:

```python

### Validation Formula or Script

To programmatically validate the answers, a script can be used to check the JSON structure and data types. Below is a simple Python script for validation:

```python
import json
from datetime import datetime

def validate_json_structure(json_data):
    try:
        # Check candidate ID
        if json_data.get(""candidate_id"") != ""GPT-4-turbo"":
            return False, ""Invalid candidate ID""

        # Validate industry trends
        industry_trends = json_data.get(""industry_trends"", [])
        if not isinstance(industry_trends, list) or len(industry_trends) == 0:
            return False, ""Industry trends must be a non-empty list""

        for trend in industry_trends:
            if not all(key in trend for key in [""title"", ""source"", ""summary""]):
                return False, ""Missing fields in industry trends""
            if not all(isinstance(trend[key], str) for key in [""title"", ""source"", ""summary""]):
                return False, ""Fields in industry trends must be strings""

        # Validate recent deals
        recent_deals = json_data.get(""recent_deals"", [])
        if not isinstance(recent_deals, list) or len(recent_deals) == 0:
            return False, ""Recent deals must be a non-empty list""

        for deal in recent_deals:
            if not all(key in deal for key in [""deal_title"", ""parties_involved"", ""date"", ""deal_summary""]):
                return False, ""Missing fields in recent deals""
            if not all(isinstance(deal[key], str) for key in [""deal_title"", ""parties_involved"", ""deal_summary""]):
                return False, ""Fields in recent deals must be strings""
            try:
                datetime.strptime(deal[""date""], ""%Y-%m-%d"")
            except ValueError:
                return False, ""Date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format""

        return True, ""Validation successful""
    except Exception as e:
        return False, str(e)

# Example usage
with open(""test_submission.json"", ""r"") as file:
    json_data = json.load(file)
    is_valid, message = validate_json_structure(json_data)
    print(message)
```

This script checks for the presence of required fields, correct data types, and valid date formats. It provides feedback on any validation errors encountered. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","Below is a Python script named `task_evaluation.py` that reads the candidate's submission from `test_submission.json` and evaluates it against the expected structure provided in `answer_key.json`. The script calculates the overall score based on the presence and correctness of the required fields and saves the results in `test_results.json`.

```python

### Explanation:
- **Candidate ID Check**: The script checks if the candidate ID matches the expected ID.
- **Industry Trends and Recent Deals**: The script checks each entry for the presence of required fields and correct data types. It also validates the date format for recent deals.
- **Overall Score Calculation**: The score is calculated based on the number of correctly filled fields relative to the total number of fields expected.
- **Output**: The results, including detailed validation results and the overall score, are saved in `test_results.json`.

### Usage:
1. Place `task_evaluation.py`, `test_submission.json`, and `answer_key.json` in the same directory.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
3. Check `test_results.json` for the evaluation results."

     - **Bananas**: Initial 200 + 50 - 20 - 10 = 220
     - **Grapes**: Initial 120 - 10 + 15 - 5 = 120
     - **Peaches**: Initial 80 + 10 - 5 + 5 = 90

   - **Total Inventory Value**: Calculated by multiplying the final inventory of each product by its unit price and summing the results:
     - Apples: 115 * 0.50 = 57.50
     - Oranges: 125 * 0.30 = 37.50
     - Bananas: 220 * 0.20 = 44.00
     - Grapes: 120 * 0.40 = 48.00
     - Peaches: 90 * 0.60 = 54.00
     - **Total**: 57.50 + 37.50 + 44.00 + 48.00 + 54.00 = 186.00

2. **Task 2: Data Reporting**
   - **Total Number of Transactions Processed**: Sum of all transactions across all products:
     - Apples: 3 transactions
     - Oranges: 3 transactions
     - Bananas: 3 transactions
     - Grapes: 3 transactions
     - Peaches: 3 transactions
     - **Total**: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15

   - **Inventory Discrepancies**: There should be no discrepancies if the candidate followed the instructions correctly. Therefore, the answer is ""None"".

#### Passing Criteria

- **Task 1**: The candidate must correctly update the inventory levels and calculate the total inventory value. The spreadsheet should reflect accurate and up-to-date records.
- **Task 2**: The candidate must correctly calculate the total number of transactions and the total inventory value, and identify any discrepancies accurately.

To pass, the candidate must:
- Submit a correctly updated spreadsheet.
- Submit a correctly completed report with accurate calculations for total transactions and inventory value.
- Correctly identify any discrepancies (or confirm there are none).

#### Programmatic Validation

To programmatically validate the answers, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import json

def validate_submission(submission_json):
    with open(submission_json, 'r') as file:
        submission = json.load(file)

    # Expected values
    expected_total_transactions = 15
    expected_total_inventory_value = 186.00
    expected_discrepancies = ""None""

    # Validate task 2 answers
    if (submission['task_2']['total_transactions'] == expected_total_transactions and
        abs(submission['task_2']['total_inventory_value'] - expected_total_inventory_value) < 0.01 and
        submission['task_2']['inventory_discrepancies'] == expected_discrepancies):
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Example usage
is_valid = validate_submission('test_submission.json')
print(""Submission is valid:"", is_valid)
```

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","To create the `task_evaluation.py` script, we need to ensure it reads the candidate's submission and the answer key, compares the results, and outputs the evaluation in a structured JSON format. Below is the Python script that accomplishes this task:

```python

### Explanation of the Script

1. **Loading JSON Data:**
   - The `load_json` function reads a JSON file and returns its content as a Python dictionary.

2. **Comparing Answers:**
   - The `compare_answers` function takes the candidate's answers and the correct answers, compares them, and calculates the score.
   - It iterates over each product type in both tasks, checking if the candidate's answer matches the correct answer.
   - It keeps track of the total number of questions and the number of correct answers to calculate the overall score.

3. **Calculating the Overall Score:**
   - The overall score is calculated as the percentage of correct answers out of the total questions.

4. **Saving Results:**
   - The results, including detailed feedback for each product type and the overall score, are saved to a JSON file named `test_results.json`.

This script provides a comprehensive evaluation of the candidate's performance, ensuring that the results are clear and easy to interpret."

- Explanation of correct answers and how they were derived
- Passing criteria (e.g., minimum number of correct answers)
- If there are multiple valid solution approaches, provide a way to programmatically validate answers (e.g., a validation formula or script)
","Here is the complete answer key, explanation of correct answers, passing criteria, and validation approach for the basic practical exam:

### Answer Key in JSON Format

```json
{
  ""candidate_id"": ""EXAMPLE_ID"",
  ""mark_up_rates"": {
    ""product_id_1"": ""0.30"",
    ""product_id_2"": ""0.25"",
    ""product_id_3"": ""0.20""

  },
  ""new_selling_prices"": {
    ""product_id_4"": ""17.00"",
    ""product_id_5"": ""22.50""
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

#### Task 1: Mark-Up Rate Calculation

- **Objective:** Calculate the appropriate mark-up rate for each product.
- **Approach:** 
  - Analyze the product cost and competitor pricing data.
  - Determine a mark-up rate that ensures the selling price is competitive yet profitable.
  - Example Calculation: If a product costs $10 and competitors sell similar products for $13, a 30% mark-up ($10 * 1.30 = $13) would be appropriate.

#### Task 2: Mark-Down Rate and Selling Price Recommendation

- **Objective:** Recommend mark-down rates and new selling prices for underperforming products.
- **Approach:**
  - Identify products not meeting sales targets.
  - Calculate a mark-down rate that reduces the price enough to stimulate sales but minimizes profit loss.
  - Example Calculation: If a product's current price is $20 and needs a 15% mark-down to boost sales, the new price would be $20 * (1 - 0.15) = $17.

### Passing Criteria

- **Minimum Correct Answers:** The candidate must correctly calculate at least 70% of the mark-up rates and 70% of the mark-down rates and new selling prices.
- **Overall Score:** The candidate should achieve an overall accuracy of 70% across both tasks to pass.

### Validation Approach

To programmatically validate the candidate's answers, the following approach can be used:

1. **Mark-Up Rate Validation:**
   - Compare each recommended mark-up rate with the expected rate.
   - Allow a small margin of error (e.g., ±0.01) to account for rounding differences.

2. **Mark-Down Rate and New Selling Price Validation:**
   - Check if the recommended mark-down rate and new selling price match the expected values.
   - Validate that the new selling price is calculated correctly based on the mark-down rate.

3. **Script Example:**

```python
def validate_answers(candidate_answers, correct_answers):
    correct_count = 0
    total_count = 0

    # Validate mark-up rates
    for product_id, correct_rate in correct_answers['mark_up_rates'].items():
        candidate_rate = float(candidate_answers['mark_up_rates'].get(product_id, 0))
        if abs(candidate_rate - float(correct_rate)) <= 0.01:
            correct_count += 1
        total_count += 1

Here is the information given to the evaluator: <evaluation_information> Here is the complete answer key, explanation of correct answers, passing criteria, and validation approach for the basic practical exam:

### Answer Key in JSON Format

```json
{
  ""candidate_id"": ""EXAMPLE_ID"",
  ""mark_up_rates"": {
    ""product_id_1"": ""0.30"",
    ""product_id_2"": ""0.25"",
    ""product_id_3"": ""0.20""
  },
  ""mark_down_rates"": {
    ""product_id_4"": ""0.15"",
    ""product_id_5"": ""0.10""
  },
  ""new_selling_prices"": {
    ""product_id_4"": ""17.00"",
    ""product_id_5"": ""22.50""
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

#### Task 1: Mark-Up Rate Calculation

- **Objective:** Calculate the appropriate mark-up rate for each product.
- **Approach:** 
  - Analyze the product cost and competitor pricing data.
  - Determine a mark-up rate that ensures the selling price is competitive yet profitable.
  - Example Calculation: If a product costs $10 and competitors sell similar products for $13, a 30% mark-up ($10 * 1.30 = $13) would be appropriate.

#### Task 2: Mark-Down Rate and Selling Price Recommendation

- **Objective:** Recommend mark-down rates and new selling prices for underperforming products.
- **Approach:**
  - Identify products not meeting sales targets.
  - Calculate a mark-down rate that reduces the price enough to stimulate sales but minimizes profit loss.
  - Example Calculation: If a product's current price is $20 and needs a 15% mark-down to boost sales, the new price would be $20 * (1 - 0.15) = $17.

### Passing Criteria

- **Minimum Correct Answers:** The candidate must correctly calculate at least 70% of the mark-up rates and 70% of the mark-down rates and new selling prices.
- **Overall Score:** The candidate should achieve an overall accuracy of 70% across both tasks to pass.

### Validation Approach

To programmatically validate the candidate's answers, the following approach can be used:

1. **Mark-Up Rate Validation:**
   - Compare each recommended mark-up rate with the expected rate.
   - Allow a small margin of error (e.g., ±0.01) to account for rounding differences.

2. **Mark-Down Rate and New Selling Price Validation:**
   - Check if the recommended mark-down rate and new selling price match the expected values.
   - Validate that the new selling price is calculated correctly based on the mark-down rate.

3. **Script Example:**

```python
def validate_answers(candidate_answers, correct_answers):
    correct_count = 0
    total_count = 0

    # Validate mark-up rates
    for product_id, correct_rate in correct_answers['mark_up_rates'].items():
        candidate_rate = float(candidate_answers['mark_up_rates'].get(product_id, 0))
        if abs(candidate_rate - float(correct_rate)) <= 0.01:
            correct_count += 1
        total_count += 1

    # Validate mark-down rates and new selling prices
    for product_id, correct_rate in correct_answers['mark_down_rates'].items():
        candidate_rate = float(candidate_answers['mark_down_rates'].get(product_id, 0))
        if abs(candidate_rate - float(correct_rate)) <= 0.01:
            correct_count += 1
        total_count += 1

        correct_price = float(correct_answers['new_selling_prices'][product_id])
        candidate_price = float(candidate_answers['new_selling_prices'].get(product_id, 0))
        if abs(candidate_price - correct_price) <= 0.01:
            correct_count += 1
        total_count += 1

    return correct_count / total_count >= 0.7

# Example usage
candidate_answers = {
    ""mark_up_rates"": {
        ""product_id_1"": ""0.30"",
        ""product_id_2"": ""0.25"",
        ""product_id_3"": ""0.20""
    },
    ""mark_down_rates"": {
        ""product_id_4"": ""0.15"",
        ""product_id_5"": ""0.10""
    },
    ""new_selling_prices"": {
        ""product_id_4"": ""17.00"",
        ""product_id_5"": ""22.50""
    }
}

print(validate_answers(candidate_answers, correct_answers))  # Should return True if the candidate passes

#### Explanation of Correct Answers

1. **Task 1: Sales Data Analysis**
   - **Top 3 Products:** The candidate should identify the products with the highest sales growth by calculating the percentage increase in sales from the beginning to the end of the year for each product. The top 3 products with the highest growth percentages should be listed.
   - **Highest Sales Month:** The candidate should sum the total sales for each month and identify the month with the highest total. This is typically a month with significant consumer activity, such as December due to holiday shopping.
   - **Analysis:** The candidate should provide a brief explanation for the peak sales month, considering factors like holidays, promotions, or seasonal demand.

2. **Task 2: Economic Condition Analysis**
   - **Economic Conditions:** The candidate should research current economic indicators such as inflation rates, consumer confidence, and employment rates. A concise summary of these conditions should be provided.
   - **Predicted Impact:** Based on the economic conditions, the candidate should predict how consumer buying patterns might change. For example, high consumer confidence and low unemployment might lead to increased spending.

#### Passing Criteria

- **Task 1:**
  - Correctly identify at least 2 out of the 3 top products.
  - Correctly identify the month with the highest sales.
  - Provide a reasonable analysis for the peak sales month.

- **Task 2:**
  - Provide an accurate summary of current economic conditions.
  - Offer a logical prediction of consumer buying patterns based on the economic conditions.

To pass, the candidate must meet the criteria for both tasks.

#### Validation Approach

- **Task 1:**
  - Use a script to calculate the percentage growth for each product and verify the top 3 products.
  - Sum monthly sales to verify the highest sales month.
  - Check if the analysis mentions relevant factors like holidays or promotions.

- **Task 2:**
  - Compare the candidate's summary with current economic data from reliable sources (e.g., government reports, financial news).
  - Ensure the prediction logically follows from the economic conditions described.

This structured approach ensures that the candidate's ability to analyze sales data and economic conditions is thoroughly evaluated, providing a clear benchmark for passing the exam. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","Below is a Python script named `task_evaluation.py` that reads the candidate's submission from `test_submission.json` and the answer key from `answer_key.json`. It evaluates the candidate's performance based on the criteria provided and saves the results in `test_results.json`.

```python
import json

def load_json(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

def evaluate_task_1(candidate, answer_key):
    score = 0
    max_score = 3

    # Evaluate top 3 products
    candidate_products = set(candidate['top_3_products'])
    answer_products = set(answer_key['top_3_products'])
    correct_products = candidate_products.intersection(answer_products)
    score += len(correct_products)

    # Evaluate highest sales month
    if candidate['highest_sales_month'] == answer_key['highest_sales_month']:
        score += 1

    # Evaluate analysis (basic check for relevant keywords)
    analysis_keywords = [""holiday"", ""promotion"", ""seasonal""]
    if any(keyword in candidate['analysis'].lower() for keyword in analysis_keywords):
        score += 1

        score += 1

    # Evaluate predicted impact (basic check for logical prediction)
    if ""spending"" in candidate['predicted_impact'].lower():
        score += 1

    return score, max_score

def main():
    candidate_submission = load_json('test_submission.json')
    answer_key = load_json('answer_key.json')

    task_1_score, task_1_max = evaluate_task_1(candidate_submission['task_1'], answer_key['task_1'])
    task_2_score, task_2_max = evaluate_task_2(candidate_submission['task_2'], answer_key['task_2'])

    total_score = task_1_score + task_2_score
    total_max_score = task_1_max + task_2_max

```

### Explanation of the Script

1. **Loading JSON Files**: The script uses a helper function `load_json` to read JSON files.

2. **Evaluation Functions**:
   - `evaluate_task_1`: Compares the candidate's top 3 products and highest sales month with the answer key. It also checks if the analysis contains relevant keywords.
   - `evaluate_task_2`: Checks if the economic conditions summary includes key economic terms and if the predicted impact logically mentions consumer spending.

3. **Scoring**:
   - Each task has a maximum score, and the script calculates the score based on the criteria.
   - The overall score is calculated as a percentage of the total possible points.

4. **Output**:
   - The results, including detailed scores and the overall percentage, are saved in `test_results.json`.

This script provides a basic automated evaluation of the candidate's submission based on the provided criteria. Adjustments can be made to the keyword checks and scoring logic to better fit specific evaluation needs."

- If the exam doesn't require any additional material, just respond with ""No material required"".
- Else create synthetic test materials (CSV contents, datasets, etc.) that have predictable outcomes. Include the actual content to be provided to candidates and ensure all materials have clear identifiers, labels, or pre-defined categories that prevent ambiguity.

IMPORTANT: When designing the test, eliminate any opportunities for candidates to make arbitrary choices (like custom account codes, naming conventions, or classification systems) that would complicate evaluation. Either:
- Provide pre-defined structures/codes that must be used, or
- Design questions with objectively verifiable numerical/text answers that don't depend on the candidate's approach

### Explanation of Correct Answers

1. **Task 1: Legal and Regulatory Research**
   - **ITAR:** This regulation is crucial for international trade involving defense-related articles. The candidate should identify this regulation to ensure compliance with export controls.
   - **RoHS Directive:** This is a key environmental regulation that restricts hazardous substances in electronic products. Identifying this ensures the candidate is aware of environmental compliance.
   - **CPSIA:** This regulation ensures consumer safety for products. Identifying this shows the candidate's understanding of product safety standards.

2. **Task 2: Compliance Checklist Creation**
   - Each checklist item should directly relate to the laws identified in Task 1, demonstrating the candidate's ability to translate legal requirements into actionable steps.

### Passing Criteria

- **Task 1:** The candidate must correctly identify at least two out of three relevant laws or regulations and provide accurate descriptions and applications.
- **Task 2:** The candidate must create a compliance checklist with at least two items that correctly correspond to the laws identified in Task 1.

### Validation of Answers

To programmatically validate the answers, the following checks can be implemented:

1. **Task 1 Validation:**
   - Check if the JSON contains at least two valid laws or regulations with correct descriptions and applications.
   - Validate that the names of the laws/regulations match known regulations related to the scenario.

2. **Task 2 Validation:**
   - Ensure that each checklist item corresponds to a law/regulation identified in Task 1.
   - Validate that the checklist items are actionable and relevant to the purchasing process.

By using these criteria and validation methods, evaluators can effectively assess the candidate's ability to monitor and follow applicable laws and regulations in purchasing activities. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","To create the `task_evaluation.py` script, we need to implement a Python program that reads the candidate's submission and the answer key, compares them, and calculates the score based on the provided criteria. Here's how you can implement this:

### Explanation of the Script

1. **Loading JSON Files:** The `load_json` function reads a JSON file and returns its content as a Python dictionary.

2. **Task 1 Evaluation:** The `evaluate_task_1` function compares the candidate's identified laws and regulations with the answer key. It checks for correct names, descriptions, and applications, and counts the number of correct entries.

3. **Task 2 Evaluation:** The `evaluate_task_2` function checks the compliance checklist items against the answer key, ensuring that each item corresponds to a law or regulation identified in Task 1.

4. **Scoring:** The script calculates the overall score as a percentage of correct answers out of the total possible correct answers.

5. **Output:** The results, including detailed task results and the overall score, are saved to `test_results.json`.

This script provides a structured way to evaluate the candidate's performance based on the provided criteria and outputs the results in a JSON format."

- If there are multiple valid solution approaches, provide a way to programmatically validate answers (e.g., a validation formula or script)
","To create a comprehensive answer key and evaluation criteria for the basic practical exam, we need to simulate the data and expected outcomes based on the tasks described. Below is a structured approach to the answer key, explanation, passing criteria, and validation method.

### Complete Answer Key in JSON Format

Assuming hypothetical data for the tasks, here is a sample answer key:

```json
{
  ""candidate_id"": ""GPT-4-turbo"",
  ""task_1"": [
    {
      ""product_name"": ""Product A"",
      ""chosen_supplier"": ""Supplier X""
    },
    {
      ""product_name"": ""Product B"",
      ""chosen_supplier"": ""Supplier Y""
    }
  ],
  ""task_2"": [
    {
      ""product_name"": ""Product A"",
      ""quantity_purchased"": 100,
      ""total_cost"": 500.00
    },
    {
      ""product_name"": ""Product B"",
      ""quantity_purchased"": 50,
      ""total_cost"": 300.00
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

#### Task 1: Price and Quality Comparison

- **Product A:** Supplier X was chosen because they offered the best combination of price and quality, and they could meet the required quantity.
- **Product B:** Supplier Y was selected for similar reasons, providing the best value in terms of price and quality while meeting quantity needs.

#### Task 2: Budget Allocation

- **Product A:** The budget was allocated to purchase 100 units at a total cost of $500.00, maximizing the quantity and quality within the budget constraints.
- **Product B:** 50 units were purchased for a total cost of $300.00, again optimizing for quality and quantity within the given budget.

### Passing Criteria

- **Task 1:** The candidate must correctly identify the best supplier for at least 80% of the products listed.
- **Task 2:** The candidate must allocate the budget effectively, purchasing at least 80% of the required products while staying within budget and maximizing quality and quantity.

### Validation Method

To programmatically validate the answers, we can use a script that checks the following:

1. **Task 1 Validation:**
   - Compare the candidate's chosen suppliers against the answer key.
   - Ensure that the chosen supplier can meet the required quantity and offers the best price-quality ratio.

2. **Task 2 Validation:**
   - Verify that the total cost for each product does not exceed the budget.
   - Check that the quantity purchased aligns with the priorities and budget constraints.

Here is a simple Python script outline for validation:

```python
def validate_task_1(candidate_answers, answer_key):
    correct_count = 0
    for candidate, correct in zip(candidate_answers, answer_key):
        if candidate['chosen_supplier'] == correct['chosen_supplier']:
            correct_count += 1
    return correct_count / len(answer_key) >= 0.8

def validate_task_2(candidate_answers, answer_key, total_budget):
    total_spent = 0
    for candidate, correct in zip(candidate_answers, answer_key):
        if (candidate['quantity_purchased'] == correct['quantity_purchased'] and
            candidate['total_cost'] == correct['total_cost']):
            total_spent += candidate['total_cost']
    return total_spent <= total_budget

# Example usage
candidate_json = {
    ""task_1"": [
        {""product_name"": ""Product A"", ""chosen_supplier"": ""Supplier X""},
        {""product_name"": ""Product B"", ""chosen_supplier"": ""Supplier Y""}
    ],
    ""task_2"": [
        {""product_name"": ""Product A"", ""quantity_purchased"": 100, ""total_cost"": 500.00},
        {""product_name"": ""Product B"", ""quantity_purchased"": 50, ""total_cost"": 300.00}
    ]
}

answer_key_json = {
    ""task_1"": [
        {""product_name"": ""Product A"", ""chosen_supplier"": ""Supplier X""},
        {""product_name"": ""Product B"", ""chosen_supplier"": ""Supplier Y""}
    ],
    ""task_2"": [
        {""product_name"": ""Product A"", ""quantity_purchased"": 100, ""total_cost"": 500.00},
        {""product_name"": ""Product B"", ""quantity_purchased"": 50, ""total_cost"": 300.00}
    ]
}

total_budget = 1000.00

task_1_pass = validate_task_1(candidate_json['task_1'], answer_key_json['task_1'])
task_2_pass = validate_task_2(candidate_json['task_2'], answer_key_json['task_2'], total_budget)

print(""Task 1 Pass:"", task_1_pass)
print(""Task 2 Pass:"", task_2_pass)
```

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","Below is a Python script named `task_evaluation.py` that reads the candidate's submission from `test_submission.json` and the answer key from `answer_key.json`. It evaluates the candidate's performance and saves the results in `test_results.json`, including an overall score as a percentage.

```python

### Explanation of the Script

1. **Loading JSON Files:** The script uses a helper function `load_json` to read JSON data from files.

2. **Task 1 Validation:** The function `validate_task_1` compares the candidate's chosen suppliers with the correct answers and counts the number of correct selections.

3. **Task 2 Validation:** The function `validate_task_2` checks if the candidate's budget allocation matches the correct answers and ensures the total cost does not exceed the budget.

4. **Overall Score Calculation:** The function `calculate_overall_score` computes the overall score as a percentage of correct answers out of the total possible correct answers.

5. **Results Preparation and Saving:** The script prepares a results dictionary containing detailed scores for each task and the overall score, then saves it to `test_results.json`.

This script assumes that the `test_submission.json` and `answer_key.json` files are correctly formatted and located in the same directory as the script. Adjust the total budget in the `validate_task_2` function if necessary based on the actual exam constraints."

  }
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers and How They Were Derived

**Task 1: Price Proposal Analysis**

- **Cost Components:**
  - **Materials:** The cost of raw materials required for the product. This value is extracted directly from the price proposal.
  - **Labor:** The cost associated with the workforce needed to produce the product. This is also found in the proposal.
  - **Overhead:** Indirect costs such as utilities, rent, and administrative expenses. This is typically a percentage of the total direct costs.
  - **Profit Margin:** The percentage added to the total cost to ensure profitability. This is often based on industry standards.

- **Total Cost:** Sum of materials, labor, and overhead. In this example, it is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Total Cost} = \text{Materials} + \text{Labor} + \text{Overhead} = 5000.00 + 3000.00 + 1500.00 = 9500.00
  \]

- **Suggested Price:** Calculated by adding the profit margin to the total cost. The profit margin is applied as a percentage of the total cost:
  \[
  \text{Suggested Price} = \text{Total Cost} \times (1 + \frac{\text{Profit Margin}}{100}) = 9500.00 \times 1.20 = 11400.00
  \]

**Task 2: Financial Report Analysis**

- **Analysis:** The candidate should identify trends such as consistent price increases, stable sales volumes, and market trends like increased demand for specific product types. This requires interpreting the data in the spreadsheet.

- **Pricing Strategy:** Based on the analysis, the candidate should recommend a strategy that aligns with market conditions and company goals. For example, increasing prices to match demand trends while ensuring competitiveness.

### Passing Criteria

- **Task 1:** The candidate must correctly identify all cost components and calculate the total cost and suggested price accurately. Partial credit can be given if the candidate correctly identifies some components or makes minor calculation errors.
- **Task 2:** The candidate must provide a reasonable analysis of the data and a coherent pricing strategy. The strategy should logically follow from the analysis.

**Minimum Passing Score:** The candidate must achieve at least 70% accuracy across both tasks to pass. This means correctly completing at least one task fully and making reasonable attempts on the other.

### Validation of Multiple Solution Approaches

For Task 1, different candidates might suggest slightly different profit margins based on their interpretation of industry standards. To validate this programmatically:

- Allow a range for the profit margin (e.g., 15% to 25%) and adjust the suggested price calculation accordingly.
- Use a tolerance level for numerical answers (e.g., ±5% of the correct value) to account for rounding differences.

For Task 2, use keyword matching and sentiment analysis to ensure the analysis and strategy are coherent and relevant to the data trends. This can be implemented using natural language processing techniques to check for logical consistency and relevance.","

### Explanation:
- **Loading JSON Files:** The script loads the candidate's submission and the answer key from JSON files.
- **Evaluation Functions:** Two functions, `evaluate_task_1` and `evaluate_task_2`, are used to score each task. They compare the candidate's answers to the answer key, allowing a 5% tolerance for numerical values.
- **Scoring:** Each task has a maximum score, and the script calculates the score for each task based on the candidate's performance.
- **Overall Score:** The script calculates the overall score as a percentage of the total possible points.
- **Output:** The results, including detailed scores and the overall score, are saved to `test_results.json`.

This script assumes that the candidate's JSON submission and the answer key are formatted correctly and placed in the same directory as the script. Adjustments may be needed based on the specific content of the answer key and candidate submissions."

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","Below is a Python script named `task_evaluation.py` that reads the candidate's submission from `test_submission.json` and the answer key from `answer_key.json`. It then evaluates the candidate's performance and saves the results in `test_results.json`.

```python
import json

def load_json(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

def evaluate_section(candidate_section, answer_section):
    score = 0
    total = len(answer_section)
    detailed_results = {}

    for key, correct_answer in answer_section.items():
        candidate_answer = candidate_section.get(key, """")
        if candidate_answer.strip().lower() == correct_answer.strip().lower():
            score += 1
            detailed_results[key] = ""Correct""
        else:
            detailed_results[key] = ""Incorrect""

    return score, total, detailed_results

def evaluate_submission(candidate_submission, answer_key):
    results = {}
    total_score = 0
    total_possible = 0

    # Evaluate policy draft
    policy_score, policy_total, policy_results = evaluate_section(
        candidate_submission.get(""policy_draft"", {}),
        answer_key.get(""policy_draft"", {})
    )
    results[""policy_draft""] = policy_results
    total_score += policy_score
    total_possible += policy_total

    # Evaluate procedure development
    procedure_score, procedure_total, procedure_results = evaluate_section(
        candidate_submission.get(""procedure_development"", {}),
        answer_key.get(""procedure_development"", {})
    )
    results[""procedure_development""] = procedure_results
    total_score += procedure_score
    total_possible += procedure_total

    # Calculate overall score
    overall_score = (total_score / total_possible) * 100 if total_possible > 0 else 0
    results[""overall_score""] = overall_score

    return results

def main():
    # Load candidate submission and answer key
    candidate_submission = load_json('test_submission.json')

        json.dump(results, result_file, indent=4)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Script

1. **Loading JSON Files:** The script uses a helper function `load_json` to read JSON files. It loads both the candidate's submission and the answer key.

2. **Evaluation Function:** The `evaluate_section` function compares each section of the candidate's submission against the answer key. It checks if the candidate's answers match the correct answers and assigns scores accordingly.

3. **Overall Evaluation:** The `evaluate_submission` function aggregates the scores from each section and calculates the overall score as a percentage.

4. **Saving Results:** The script saves the detailed results and the overall score in a JSON file named `test_results.json`.

5. **Execution:** The script is designed to be run as a standalone program. It reads the necessary files, evaluates the submission, and outputs the results.

This script assumes that the candidate's answers are expected to match the answer key exactly. If more flexibility is needed (e.g., partial credit or keyword matching), the evaluation logic can be adjusted accordingly."

","### Answer Key and Evaluation Guide

#### Answer Key in JSON Format

Here is a sample answer key in JSON format for automated checking. This key assumes hypothetical data and analysis based on the tasks described:

```json
{
  ""candidate_id"": ""GPT-4-turbo"",
  ""task_1"": {
    ""summary_table"": {
      ""total_costs"": 12345.67,
      ""average_delivery_time"": 5.3
    }
  },
  ""task_2"": {
    ""analysis"": {
      ""trends"": ""The data shows a consistent increase in the purchase of electronic items over the last quarter, indicating a growing demand in this category."",
      ""issues"": ""There is a noticeable delay in deliveries from Supplier X, with an average delay of 3 days beyond the expected delivery date."",
      ""recommendations"": ""Consider negotiating better delivery terms with Supplier X or exploring alternative suppliers to ensure timely deliveries.""
    }
  }
}
```

#### Explanation of Correct Answers

1. **Task 1: Data Entry and Organization**
   - **Total Costs:** The candidate should sum up all the costs from the `purchases_data.csv` file. The correct answer is a numerical value with two decimal places.
   - **Average Delivery Time:** The candidate should calculate the average delivery time in days from the delivery dates provided in the CSV file. The correct answer is a numerical value rounded to one decimal place.

2. **Task 2: Record Review and Analysis**
   - **Trends:** The candidate should identify any significant patterns or changes in product performance or inventory levels. The correct answer is a concise description of these trends.
   - **Issues:** The candidate should pinpoint any problems or inefficiencies observed in the report. The correct answer is a brief description of these issues.
   - **Recommendations:** The candidate should propose actionable steps to address the identified issues. The correct answer is a concise description of these recommendations.

#### Passing Criteria

- **Task 1:**
  - The candidate must correctly calculate and format both the total costs and average delivery time.
  - Partial credit can be given if one of the two values is correct.

- **Task 2:**
  - The candidate must provide reasonable and relevant insights for trends, issues, and recommendations.
  - Each section (trends, issues, recommendations) should be coherent and within the word limit.

- **Overall Passing Score:**
  - The candidate must achieve at least 70% accuracy across both tasks to pass. This means correctly completing at least 4 out of the 6 components (2 from Task 1 and 4 from Task 2).

#### Validation Formula or Script

To programmatically validate the answers, you can use the following approach:

1. **Task 1 Validation:**
   - Use a script to sum the costs and calculate the average delivery time from the provided CSV file. Compare these values to the candidate's submission.

2. **Task 2 Validation:**
   - Use keyword matching and sentiment analysis to ensure the candidate's descriptions align with expected trends, issues, and recommendations. This can be done using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

Here is a simple Python script outline for Task 1 validation:

```python
import pandas as pd

def validate_task_1(csv_file, candidate_json):
    # Load the CSV file
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)
    
    # Calculate total costs
    total_costs = df['cost'].sum()
    
    # Calculate average delivery time
    df['delivery_time'] = (pd.to_datetime(df['delivery_date']) - pd.to_datetime(df['order_date'])).dt.days
    average_delivery_time = df['delivery_time'].mean()
    
    # Compare with candidate's submission
    candidate_total_costs = candidate_json['task_1']['summary_table']['total_costs']
    candidate_average_delivery_time = candidate_json['task_1']['summary_table']['average_delivery_time']
    
    total_costs_correct = abs(total_costs - candidate_total_costs) < 0.01
    average_delivery_time_correct = abs(average_delivery_time - candidate_average_delivery_time) < 0.1
    
    return total_costs_correct, average_delivery_time_correct

# Example usage
candidate_json = {
    ""task_1"": {
        ""summary_table"": {
            ""total_costs"": 12345.67,
            ""average_delivery_time"": 5.3
        }
    }
}

csv_file = 'organized_purchases_data.csv'
validate_task_1(csv_file, candidate_json)
```

This script checks if the candidate's calculated values for total costs and average delivery time are within an acceptable range of the correct values. Adjust the file paths and column names as necessary based on the actual data provided.","

- **Task 2:**
  - The candidate must provide reasonable and relevant insights for trends, issues, and recommendations.
  - Each section (trends, issues, recommendations) should be coherent and within the word limit.

- **Overall Passing Score:**
  - The candidate must achieve at least 70% accuracy across both tasks to pass. This means correctly completing at least 4 out of the 6 components (2 from Task 1 and 4 from Task 2).

#### Validation Formula or Script

To programmatically validate the answers, you can use the following approach:

1. **Task 1 Validation:**
   - Use a script to sum the costs and calculate the average delivery time from the provided CSV file. Compare these values to the candidate's submission.

2. **Task 2 Validation:**
   - Use keyword matching and sentiment analysis to ensure the candidate's descriptions align with expected trends, issues, and recommendations. This can be done using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

Here is a simple Python script outline for Task 1 validation:

```python
import pandas as pd

def validate_task_1(csv_file, candidate_json):
    # Load the CSV file
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)
    
    # Calculate total costs
    total_costs = df['cost'].sum()
    
    # Calculate average delivery time
    df['delivery_time'] = (pd.to_datetime(df['delivery_date']) - pd.to_datetime(df['order_date'])).dt.days
    average_delivery_time = df['delivery_time'].mean()
    
    # Compare with candidate's submission
    candidate_total_costs = candidate_json['task_1']['summary_table']['total_costs']
    candidate_average_delivery_time = candidate_json['task_1']['summary_table']['average_delivery_time']
    
    total_costs_correct = abs(total_costs - candidate_total_costs) < 0.01
    average_delivery_time_correct = abs(average_delivery_time - candidate_average_delivery_time) < 0.1
    
    return total_costs_correct, average_delivery_time_correct

# Example usage
candidate_json = {
    ""task_1"": {
        ""summary_table"": {
            ""total_costs"": 12345.67,
            ""average_delivery_time"": 5.3
        }
    }
}

csv_file = 'organized_purchases_data.csv'
validate_task_1(csv_file, candidate_json)
```

This script checks if the candidate's calculated values for total costs and average delivery time are within an acceptable range of the correct values. Adjust the file paths and column names as necessary based on the actual data provided. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","Below is a Python script named `task_evaluation.py` that reads the candidate's submission from `test_submission.json` and the answer key from `answer_key.json`. It then evaluates the candidate's performance and saves the results in `test_results.json`.

```python
import json

def load_json(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

def evaluate_task_1(candidate, answer_key):

    candidate_average_delivery_time = candidate['task_1']['summary_table']['average_delivery_time']
    
    answer_total_costs = answer_key['task_1']['summary_table']['total_costs']
    answer_average_delivery_time = answer_key['task_1']['summary_table']['average_delivery_time']
    
    total_costs_correct = abs(answer_total_costs - candidate_total_costs) < 0.01
    average_delivery_time_correct = abs(answer_average_delivery_time - candidate_average_delivery_time) < 0.1
    
    return total_costs_correct, average_delivery_time_correct

def evaluate_task_2(candidate, answer_key):
    trends_correct = candidate['task_2']['analysis']['trends'] == answer_key['task_2']['analysis']['trends']
    issues_correct = candidate['task_2']['analysis']['issues'] == answer_key['task_2']['analysis']['issues']
    recommendations_correct = candidate['task_2']['analysis']['recommendations'] == answer_key['task_2']['analysis']['recommendations']
    
    return trends_correct, issues_correct, recommendations_correct

def calculate_overall_score(results):
    total_points = sum(results.values())
    max_points = len(results)
    return (total_points / max_points) * 100

def main():
    candidate = load_json('test_submission.json')
    answer_key = load_json('answer_key.json')
    
    task_1_results = evaluate_task_1(candidate, answer_key)
    task_2_results = evaluate_task_2(candidate, answer_key)
    
    results = {
        ""task_1_total_costs_correct"": task_1_results[0],

    results['overall_score'] = overall_score
    
    with open('test_results.json', 'w') as file:
        json.dump(results, file, indent=4)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
- **Loading JSON Files:** The script uses a helper function `load_json` to read JSON files.
- **Task Evaluation:** 
  - **Task 1:** It checks if the candidate's total costs and average delivery time are within acceptable ranges of the correct values.
  - **Task 2:** It checks if the candidate's analysis matches the expected trends, issues, and recommendations.
- **Scoring:** The script calculates the overall score as a percentage of correct answers.
- **Output:** The results, including the overall score, are saved in `test_results.json`.

### Usage:
1. Place `task_evaluation.py`, `test_submission.json`, and `answer_key.json` in the same directory.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
3. The results will be saved in `test_results.json`."

### Answer Key in JSON Format

The answer key will be a template that the evaluator can use to compare against the candidate's submission. Since the exam is practical and involves subjective evaluation, the answer key will include expected values and a range of acceptable responses.

```json
{
  ""candidate_id"": ""EVALUATOR_ID"",
  ""suppliers"": [
    {
      ""name"": ""Supplier A"",
      ""research"": {

      }
    },
    {
      ""name"": ""Supplier B"",
      ""research"": {
        ""price"": ""moderate"",
        ""quality"": ""medium"",
        ""selection"": ""moderate"",
        ""service"": ""good"",

      },
      ""evaluation"": {
        ""score"": 70,
        ""rank"": 2
      }
    }
    // Add more suppliers as needed
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

1. **Research Findings:**
   - **Price:** Evaluate based on market standards. Competitive pricing is preferred.
   - **Quality:** High quality is preferred, but medium is acceptable depending on the product.
   - **Selection:** A wide selection is advantageous for diverse needs.
   - **Service:** Excellent service indicates strong customer support.
   - **Support:** Responsive support is crucial for resolving issues quickly.
   - **Availability:** Consistent availability ensures reliable supply.
   - **Reliability:** High reliability indicates fewer disruptions.
   - **Production and Distribution:** Efficient systems reduce lead times and costs.
   - **Reputation and History:** A positive reputation suggests trustworthiness and reliability.

2. **Evaluation:**
   - **Score:** Based on a rubric that assigns points to each criterion. Higher scores indicate better overall suitability.
   - **Rank:** Suppliers are ranked from most to least suitable based on their total scores.

### Passing Criteria

- **Minimum Score:** A candidate must achieve a minimum average score of 70% across all suppliers to pass.
- **Correctness:** The candidate's research findings should align with the expected values or fall within an acceptable range.
- **Ranking Accuracy:** Suppliers should be ranked correctly based on their scores.

### Validation Formula

To programmatically validate the candidate's answers, the evaluator can use a script to check:

1. **Research Findings:** Compare each criterion's value against the expected range.
2. **Score Calculation:** Ensure the total score is calculated correctly based on the rubric.
3. **Ranking:** Verify that suppliers are ranked in descending order of their scores.

Here is a simple pseudocode for validation:

```python
def validate_submission(candidate_json, answer_key):
    for supplier in candidate_json['suppliers']:
        key_supplier = next(s for s in answer_key['suppliers'] if s['name'] == supplier['name'])
        
        # Validate research findings
        for criterion, value in supplier['research'].items():
            if value not in acceptable_values[criterion]:
                return False
        
        # Validate score
        if supplier['evaluation']['score'] != key_supplier['evaluation']['score']:
            return False
        
        # Validate rank
        if supplier['evaluation']['rank'] != key_supplier['evaluation']['rank']:
            return False
    
    return True

acceptable_values = {
    ""price"": [""competitive"", ""moderate"", ""high""],
    ""quality"": [""high"", ""medium"", ""low""],

   - **Price:** Evaluate based on market standards. Competitive pricing is preferred.
   - **Quality:** High quality is preferred, but medium is acceptable depending on the product.
   - **Selection:** A wide selection is advantageous for diverse needs.
   - **Service:** Excellent service indicates strong customer support.
   - **Support:** Responsive support is crucial for resolving issues quickly.
   - **Availability:** Consistent availability ensures reliable supply.
   - **Reliability:** High reliability indicates fewer disruptions.
   - **Production and Distribution:** Efficient systems reduce lead times and costs.
   - **Reputation and History:** A positive reputation suggests trustworthiness and reliability.

2. **Evaluation:**
   - **Score:** Based on a rubric that assigns points to each criterion. Higher scores indicate better overall suitability.
   - **Rank:** Suppliers are ranked from most to least suitable based on their total scores.

### Passing Criteria

- **Minimum Score:** A candidate must achieve a minimum average score of 70% across all suppliers to pass.
- **Correctness:** The candidate's research findings should align with the expected values or fall within an acceptable range.
- **Ranking Accuracy:** Suppliers should be ranked correctly based on their scores.

### Validation Formula

To programmatically validate the candidate's answers, the evaluator can use a script to check:

1. **Research Findings:** Compare each criterion's value against the expected range.
2. **Score Calculation:** Ensure the total score is calculated correctly based on the rubric.
3. **Ranking:** Verify that suppliers are ranked in descending order of their scores.

Here is a simple pseudocode for validation:

```python
def validate_submission(candidate_json, answer_key):
    for supplier in candidate_json['suppliers']:
        key_supplier = next(s for s in answer_key['suppliers'] if s['name'] == supplier['name'])
        
        # Validate research findings
        for criterion, value in supplier['research'].items():
            if value not in acceptable_values[criterion]:
                return False
        
        # Validate score
        if supplier['evaluation']['score'] != key_supplier['evaluation']['score']:
            return False
        
        # Validate rank
        if supplier['evaluation']['rank'] != key_supplier['evaluation']['rank']:
            return False
    
    return True

acceptable_values = {
    ""price"": [""competitive"", ""moderate"", ""high""],
    ""quality"": [""high"", ""medium"", ""low""],
    ""selection"": [""wide"", ""moderate"", ""limited""],
    ""service"": [""excellent"", ""good"", ""poor""],
    ""support"": [""responsive"", ""average"", ""unresponsive""],
    ""availability"": [""consistent"", ""variable"", ""poor""],
    ""reliability"": [""high"", ""medium"", ""low""],
    ""production_and_distribution"": [""efficient"", ""average"", ""inefficient""],
    ""reputation_and_history"": [""positive"", ""neutral"", ""negative""]
}
```

This approach ensures that the candidate's submission is evaluated consistently and fairly, focusing on their ability to research and evaluate suppliers effectively. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","Below is a Python script named `task_evaluation.py` that reads the candidate's submission from `test_submission.json` and the answer key from `answer_key.json`. It evaluates the candidate's performance and saves the results in `test_results.json`, including an `overall_score` percentage.

### Explanation of the Script

1. **Loading JSON Files:** The script uses the `load_json` function to read JSON data from files. It reads both the candidate's submission and the answer key.

2. **Validation Function:** The `validate_submission` function compares the candidate's submission against the answer key. It checks each supplier's research findings, score, and rank.

3. **Scoring:** The script calculates the total possible score and the total achieved score based on the correctness of the candidate's scores. It then computes the `overall_score` as a percentage.

4. **Results Storage:** The results, including detailed feedback for each supplier and the overall score, are saved in `test_results.json`.

5. **Execution:** The script is executed by calling the `main` function, which orchestrates the loading, validation, and saving of results.

This script provides a structured and automated way to evaluate the candidate's performance in the practical exam."

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","Below is a Python script named `task_evaluation.py` that reads the candidate's submission from `test_submission.json` and the answer key from `answer_key.json`. It evaluates the candidate's performance based on the provided criteria and saves the results in `test_results.json`.

```python
import json

def load_json(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

def evaluate_task_1(candidate, answer_key):
    score = 0
    max_score = 5
    results = {}

    for key in answer_key['task_1']:
        candidate_value = candidate['task_1'].get(key, """").lower()
        answer_value = answer_key['task_1'][key].lower()
        if answer_value in candidate_value:
            score += 1
            results[key] = ""Correct""
        else:
            results[key] = ""Incorrect""

    return score, max_score, results

def evaluate_task_2(candidate, answer_key):
    score = 0

                answer_issue['suggestion'].lower() in candidate_issue['suggestion'].lower()):
                issue_found = True
                break
        if issue_found:
            score += 1
            results.append({""issue"": answer_issue['issue'], ""result"": ""Correct""})
        else:
            results.append({""issue"": answer_issue['issue'], ""result"": ""Incorrect""})

    return score, max_score, results

def main():

```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

- **Task 1: Catalog and Periodical Review**
  - The candidate is expected to identify items related to ""office supplies"" with a price under $100 from the provided catalog and periodical.
  - The correct answers include items like ""Stapler"" and ""Notebook"" which are common office supplies and are priced under $100.
  - The source indicates where the item was found, either in the ""Catalog"" or ""Periodical"".

- **Task 2: Internet and Directory Search**
  - The candidate needs to find at least two suppliers for ""ergonomic office chairs"".
  - Correct answers include suppliers like ""ErgoChairs Inc."" and ""Comfort Seating Solutions"", with valid URLs and contact information.
  - The focus is on finding reliable suppliers with accessible contact details.

### Passing Criteria

- **Task 1:** The candidate must correctly identify at least two items that meet the criteria (office supplies under $100) from the provided materials.
- **Task 2:** The candidate must correctly identify at least two suppliers for ergonomic office chairs, including valid URLs and contact information.

To pass the exam, the candidate must successfully complete both tasks by meeting the minimum criteria outlined above.

### Validation Approach

To programmatically validate the answers, the following checks can be implemented:

1. **Task 1 Validation:**
   - Ensure that each item listed has a name, price, supplier, and source.
   - Verify that the price is under $100 and the source is either ""Catalog"" or ""Periodical"".
   - Check that the items are related to ""office supplies"".

2. **Task 2 Validation:**
   - Ensure that each supplier entry includes a name, URL, and contact information.
   - Validate that the URLs are well-formed and lead to a legitimate website.
   - Confirm that the contact information is complete and plausible (e.g., contains an email or phone number).

By implementing these checks, the evaluator can automatically verify the correctness of the candidate's submission. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","To create the `task_evaluation.py` script, we need to implement a Python program that reads the candidate's submission and the answer key, compares them, and calculates the score based on the criteria provided. Here's how you can implement this:

```python
import json

def load_json(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

def validate_task_1(candidate_items, answer_items):
    correct_items = 0
    for candidate_item in candidate_items:
        for answer_item in answer_items:
            if (candidate_item['name'] == answer_item['name'] and
                candidate_item['price'] == answer_item['price'] and
                candidate_item['supplier'] == answer_item['supplier'] and
                candidate_item['source'] == answer_item['source']):
                correct_items += 1
                break
    return correct_items

def validate_task_2(candidate_suppliers, answer_suppliers):
    correct_suppliers = 0
    for candidate_supplier in candidate_suppliers:
        for answer_supplier in answer_suppliers:
            if (candidate_supplier['name'] == answer_supplier['name'] and
                candidate_supplier['url'] == answer_supplier['url'] and
                candidate_supplier['contact_info'] == answer_supplier['contact_info']):
                correct_suppliers += 1
                break
    return correct_suppliers

def evaluate_submission(candidate_submission, answer_key):
    task_1_score = validate_task_1(candidate_submission['task_1']['items'], answer_key['task_1']['items'])
    task_2_score = validate_task_2(candidate_submission['task_2']['suppliers'], answer_key['task_2']['suppliers'])

    # Calculate the total possible correct answers
    total_task_1_items = len(answer_key['task_1']['items'])
    total_task_2_suppliers = len(answer_key['task_2']['suppliers'])

    # Calculate the overall score
    total_correct = task_1_score + task_2_score
    total_possible = total_task_1_items + total_task_2_suppliers
    overall_score = (total_correct / total_possible) * 100

    return {
        ""task_1_score"": task_1_score,
        ""task_2_score"": task_2_score,
        ""overall_score"": overall_score
    }

def main():
    candidate_submission = load_json('test_submission.json')
    answer_key = load_json('answer_key.json')['answer_key']

    results = evaluate_submission(candidate_submission, answer_key)

    with open('test_results.json', 'w') as result_file:
        json.dump(results, result_file, indent=4)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Script

1. **Loading JSON Files:** The `load_json` function reads a JSON file and returns its content as a Python dictionary.

2. **Validation Functions:**
   - `validate_task_1`: Compares each item in the candidate's submission for Task 1 with the answer key. It counts how many items match exactly.
   - `validate_task_2`: Similar to `validate_task_1`, but for Task 2, comparing suppliers.

3. **Evaluation Function:**
   - `evaluate_submission`: Uses the validation functions to calculate scores for each task and computes the overall score as a percentage.

4. **Main Function:**
   - Loads the candidate's submission and the answer key.
   - Evaluates the submission.
   - Writes the results to `test_results.json`.

This script will automatically score the candidate's performance based on the provided answer key and save the results in a structured JSON format."

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","To create a Python script named `task_evaluation.py` that evaluates the candidate's submission against the provided answer key, we need to implement several checks as described in the evaluation information. The script will read the candidate's submission and the answer key, compare them, and output the results in a structured JSON format. Here's how you can implement this:

```python
import json
import os

def load_json(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

def validate_graph_image():
    return os.path.exists('price_trend_graph.png')

def validate_word_count(text, min_words, max_words):
    word_count = len(text.split())
    return min_words <= word_count <= max_words

def validate_urls(urls):
    return all(url.startswith(""http"") for url in urls)

def evaluate_submission(candidate_submission, answer_key):
    results = {
        ""Task1"": {
            ""graph_image"": False,
            ""analysis"": False
        },
        ""Task2"": {
            ""sources"": False,
            ""report"": False
        },
        ""overall_score"": 0
    }

    if validate_graph_image():
        results[""Task1""][""graph_image""] = True

    if validate_word_count(candidate_submission[""Task1""][""analysis""], 100, 200):
        results[""Task1""][""analysis""] = True

    # Task 2 Evaluation
    if validate_urls(candidate_submission[""Task2""][""sources""]):
        results[""Task2""][""sources""] = True

    if validate_word_count(candidate_submission[""Task2""][""report""], 150, 250):
        results[""Task2""][""report""] = True

    # Calculate overall score
    total_criteria = 4
    passed_criteria = sum([
        results[""Task1""][""graph_image""],
        results[""Task1""][""analysis""],
        results[""Task2""][""sources""],
        results[""Task2""][""report""]
    ])
    results[""overall_score""] = (passed_criteria / total_criteria) * 100

    return results

def main():
    candidate_submission = load_json('test_submission.json')
    answer_key = load_json('answer_key.json')  # Assuming the answer key is provided as 'answer_key.json'

    results = evaluate_submission(candidate_submission, answer_key)

    with open('test_results.json', 'w') as result_file:
        json.dump(results, result_file, indent=4)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Script:

1. **Loading JSON Files**: The script loads the candidate's submission and the answer key from JSON files.

2. **Validation Functions**:
   - `validate_graph_image()`: Checks if the graph image file exists.
   - `validate_word_count(text, min_words, max_words)`: Checks if the text is within the specified word count range.
   - `validate_urls(urls)`: Ensures all URLs in the list are valid (start with ""http"").

3. **Evaluation Logic**:
   - For Task 1, it checks if the graph image exists and if the analysis is within the word count.
   - For Task 2, it checks if the URLs are valid and if the report is within the word count.

4. **Scoring**: The script calculates the overall score based on the number of criteria met.

5. **Output**: The results are saved in a JSON file named `test_results.json`.

This script provides a basic framework for evaluating the candidate's submission. You can expand it with more sophisticated checks, such as content validation, if needed."

### Explanation of Correct Answers and How They Were Derived

**Task 1: Duty Payment Calculation**

- **Objective**: Calculate the total duty payment for each item.
- **Method**: For each item, multiply the item's value by the duty rate to get the total duty payment.
  - Example Calculation: If an item has a value of $1000 and a duty rate of 15%, the total duty payment is $1000 * 0.15 = $150.00.

**Task 2: Freight Charge Arrangement**

- **Objective**: Determine the appropriate freight charges for each shipment.
- **Method**: Use online resources or freight calculators to find the cost based on shipment details such as weight, destination, and shipping method.
  - Example Calculation: If a shipment weighs 10 kg and the rate is $6 per kg, the freight charge is 10 * $6 = $60.00.

### Passing Criteria

- **Accuracy**: The candidate must correctly calculate at least 80% of the duty payments and freight charges.
- **JSON Structure**: The JSON file must be correctly formatted and include all required fields.
- **Completeness**: All items and shipments listed in the provided materials must be accounted for in the submission.

### Validation Formula or Script

To programmatically validate the answers, a script can be used to compare the candidate's submission against the answer key. Below is a pseudo-code example of how this validation might be implemented:

```python
def validate_submission(candidate_json, answer_key_json):
    correct_duty_count = 0
    correct_freight_count = 0
    
    # Validate duty payments
    for candidate_item in candidate_json['duty_payments']:
        for answer_item in answer_key_json['duty_payments']:
            if candidate_item['item_id'] == answer_item['item_id']:
                if abs(candidate_item['total_duty'] - answer_item['total_duty']) < 0.01:
                    correct_duty_count += 1
    
    # Validate freight charges
    for candidate_shipment in candidate_json['freight_charges']:
        for answer_shipment in answer_key_json['freight_charges']:
            if candidate_shipment['shipment_id'] == answer_shipment['shipment_id']:
                if abs(candidate_shipment['freight_charge'] - answer_shipment['freight_charge']) < 0.01:
                    correct_freight_count += 1
    
    total_duty_items = len(answer_key_json['duty_payments'])
    total_freight_items = len(answer_key_json['freight_charges'])
    
    duty_accuracy = correct_duty_count / total_duty_items
    freight_accuracy = correct_freight_count / total_freight_items
    
    return duty_accuracy >= 0.8 and freight_accuracy >= 0.8

# Example usage
candidate_json = load_json('test_submission.json')
answer_key_json = load_json('answer_key.json')
is_passing = validate_submission(candidate_json, answer_key_json)
```

This script checks each item and shipment in the candidate's submission against the answer key, allowing for a small margin of error in numerical calculations. The candidate passes if they achieve at least 80% accuracy in both tasks.","

                    correct_duty_count += 1
    
    # Validate freight charges
    for candidate_shipment in candidate_json['freight_charges']:
        for answer_shipment in answer_key_json['freight_charges']:
            if candidate_shipment['shipment_id'] == answer_shipment['shipment_id']:
                if abs(candidate_shipment['freight_charge'] - answer_shipment['freight_charge']) < 0.01:
                    correct_freight_count += 1
    
    total_duty_items = len(answer_key_json['duty_payments'])
    total_freight_items = len(answer_key_json['freight_charges'])
    
    duty_accuracy = correct_duty_count / total_duty_items
    freight_accuracy = correct_freight_count / total_freight_items
    
    return duty_accuracy >= 0.8 and freight_accuracy >= 0.8

# Example usage
candidate_json = load_json('test_submission.json')
answer_key_json = load_json('answer_key.json')
is_passing = validate_submission(candidate_json, answer_key_json)
```

This script checks each item and shipment in the candidate's submission against the answer key, allowing for a small margin of error in numerical calculations. The candidate passes if they achieve at least 80% accuracy in both tasks. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","Below is a Python script named `task_evaluation.py` that reads the candidate's submission from `test_submission.json` and the answer key from `answer_key.json`. It evaluates the candidate's performance and saves the results in `test_results.json`.

### Explanation:
- **Loading JSON Files**: The script uses the `load_json` function to read JSON data from files.
- **Validation**: The `validate_submission` function compares the candidate's results with the answer key. It checks each duty payment and freight charge for correctness, allowing a small margin of error (0.01) for numerical calculations.
- **Results Compilation**: The script compiles detailed results for each item and shipment, indicating whether the candidate's answer was correct.
- **Overall Score**: The overall score is calculated as the average of the duty and freight accuracy percentages, converted to a percentage.
- **Output**: The results, including detailed feedback and the overall score, are saved to `test_results.json`.

This script provides a comprehensive evaluation of the candidate's performance, offering both detailed feedback and an overall score."

The exam is designed to simulate real-world scenarios that a Claims Adjuster, Examiner, or Investigator might encounter in their daily work.

**Structure:**
The exam is divided into two main tasks, each designed to test specific skills required for processing claims:

1. **Task 1: Document Review and Verification**
   - The candidate will be provided with a set of claim documents in PDF format. These documents will include claim forms, supporting evidence, and policy details.
   - The candidate must review these documents to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information provided.
   - The candidate will identify any discrepancies or missing information and document their findings in a structured JSON format.

2. **Task 2: Claim Calculation and Decision Making**
   - The candidate will receive a spreadsheet containing a list of claims with associated details such as claim amount, policy limits, and authority levels.
   - The candidate must calculate the payable amount for each claim based on the provided data and their designated authority level.
   - The candidate will decide whether to approve or deny each claim and provide a brief justification for their decision in the structured JSON format.

**Submission:**
The candidate will submit their answers in a structured JSON file named ""test_submission.json"". This file will include their findings from the document review, calculated claim amounts, and decisions for each claim. This format ensures that the evaluator can easily assess the candidate's ability to process claims accurately and within their authority level. </examoverview>

### Your assignment:

Based on the explanation write clear, concise instructions for the candidate including:
- What they need to accomplish (without prescribing specific methods)
- Brief description of any materials that will be provided
- Expected format for answer submission
- The actual test they need perform, i.e. the tasks that need to be done or questions that need to be answered.

IMPORTANT: When designing the test, eliminate any opportunities for candidates to make arbitrary choices (like custom account codes, naming conventions, or classification systems) that would complicate evaluation. Either:
- Provide pre-defined structures/codes that must be used, or
- Design questions with objectively verifiable numerical/text answers that don't depend on the candidate's approach

      ""decision"": ""deny"",
      ""justification"": ""Missing required medical report""
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

1. **Document Review and Verification:**
   - **Claim ID 12345:**
     - Discrepancies: The claim documents are missing a signature and have an incorrect policy number. These are critical for verifying the authenticity and correctness of the claim.
     - Missing Information: Proof of purchase is required to validate the claim amount.
   - **Claim ID 67890:**
     - Discrepancies: No discrepancies found.
     - Missing Information: A medical report is necessary to substantiate the claim.

2. **Claim Calculation and Decision Making:**
   - **Claim ID 12345:**
     - Calculated Payable Amount: $5000.00, which is within the policy limit and the candidate's authority level.
     - Decision: Approve, as the claim amount is justified and within limits.
   - **Claim ID 67890:**
     - Calculated Payable Amount: $0.00, as the claim cannot be processed without the medical report.
     - Decision: Deny, due to missing critical documentation.

### Passing Criteria

- The candidate must correctly identify all discrepancies and missing information for at least 80% of the claims.
- The candidate must correctly calculate the payable amount and make the correct decision (approve/deny) for at least 80% of the claims.
- Both tasks must be completed with a minimum of 80% accuracy to pass.

### Programmatic Validation of Answers

To programmatically validate the candidate's answers, a script can be used to compare the candidate's JSON submission against the answer key. Here is a simple validation approach:

```python
import json

def validate_submission(candidate_json, answer_key_json):
    # Load the JSON data
    candidate_data = json.loads(candidate_json)
    answer_key_data = json.loads(answer_key_json)
    
    # Initialize counters
    correct_document_reviews = 0
    correct_claim_decisions = 0
    
    # Validate document reviews
    for candidate_review in candidate_data['document_review']:
        for answer_review in answer_key_data['document_review']:
            if candidate_review['claim_id'] == answer_review['claim_id']:
                if (set(candidate_review['discrepancies']) == set(answer_review['discrepancies']) and
                    set(candidate_review['missing_information']) == set(answer_review['missing_information'])):
                    correct_document_reviews += 1
    
    # Validate claim decisions
    for candidate_decision in candidate_data['claim_decisions']:
        for answer_decision in answer_key_data['claim_decisions']:
            if candidate_decision['claim_id'] == answer_decision['claim_id']:
                if (candidate_decision['calculated_payable_amount'] == answer_decision['calculated_payable_amount'] and
                    candidate_decision['decision'] == answer_decision['decision'] and
                    candidate_decision['justification'] == answer_decision['justification']):
                    correct_claim_decisions += 1
    
    # Calculate accuracy
    document_review_accuracy = correct_document_reviews / len(answer_key_data['document_review'])

Here is brief explanation of the exam's purpose and structure intended for the evaluator: <examoverview> ### Exam Purpose and Structure

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this basic practical exam is to assess the candidate's ability to accurately pay and process claims within their designated authority level. This involves evaluating their skills in reviewing claim documents, verifying information, calculating claim amounts, and making decisions based on predefined authority limits. The exam is designed to simulate real-world scenarios that a Claims Adjuster, Examiner, or Investigator might encounter in their daily work.

**Structure:**
The exam is divided into two main tasks, each designed to test specific skills required for processing claims:

1. **Task 1: Document Review and Verification**
   - The candidate will be provided with a set of claim documents in PDF format. These documents will include claim forms, supporting evidence, and policy details.
   - The candidate must review these documents to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information provided.
   - The candidate will identify any discrepancies or missing information and document their findings in a structured JSON format.

2. **Task 2: Claim Calculation and Decision Making**
   - The candidate will receive a spreadsheet containing a list of claims with associated details such as claim amount, policy limits, and authority levels.
   - The candidate must calculate the payable amount for each claim based on the provided data and their designated authority level.
   - The candidate will decide whether to approve or deny each claim and provide a brief justification for their decision in the structured JSON format.

**Submission:**
The candidate will submit their answers in a structured JSON file named ""test_submission.json"". This file will include their findings from the document review, calculated claim amounts, and decisions for each claim. This format ensures that the evaluator can easily assess the candidate's ability to process claims accurately and within their authority level.</examoverview>

### Complete Answer Key in JSON Format

```json
{
  ""candidate_id"": ""EXAMPLE_ID"",
  ""document_review"": [
    {
      ""claim_id"": ""12345"",
      ""discrepancies"": [""Missing signature"", ""Incorrect policy number""],
      ""missing_information"": [""Proof of purchase""]
    },
    {
      ""claim_id"": ""67890"",
      ""discrepancies"": [],
      ""missing_information"": [""Medical report""]
    }
  ],
  ""claim_decisions"": [
    {
      ""claim_id"": ""12345"",
      ""calculated_payable_amount"": 5000.00,
      ""decision"": ""approve"",
      ""justification"": ""Claim amount within policy limit and authority level""
    },
    {
      ""claim_id"": ""67890"",
      ""calculated_payable_amount"": 0.00,
      ""decision"": ""deny"",
      ""justification"": ""Missing required medical report""
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

1. **Document Review and Verification:**
   - **Claim ID 12345:**
     - Discrepancies: The claim documents are missing a signature and have an incorrect policy number. These are critical for verifying the authenticity and correctness of the claim.
     - Missing Information: Proof of purchase is required to validate the claim amount.
   - **Claim ID 67890:**
     - Discrepancies: No discrepancies found.
     - Missing Information: A medical report is necessary to substantiate the claim.

2. **Claim Calculation and Decision Making:**
   - **Claim ID 12345:**
     - Calculated Payable Amount: $5000.00, which is within the policy limit and the candidate's authority level.
     - Decision: Approve, as the claim amount is justified and within limits.
   - **Claim ID 67890:**
     - Calculated Payable Amount: $0.00, as the claim cannot be processed without the medical report.
     - Decision: Deny, due to missing critical documentation.

### Passing Criteria

- The candidate must correctly identify all discrepancies and missing information for at least 80% of the claims.
- The candidate must correctly calculate the payable amount and make the correct decision (approve/deny) for at least 80% of the claims.
- Both tasks must be completed with a minimum of 80% accuracy to pass.

### Programmatic Validation of Answers

To programmatically validate the candidate's answers, a script can be used to compare the candidate's JSON submission against the answer key. Here is a simple validation approach:

```python
import json

def validate_submission(candidate_json, answer_key_json):
    # Load the JSON data
    candidate_data = json.loads(candidate_json)
    answer_key_data = json.loads(answer_key_json)
    
    # Initialize counters
    correct_document_reviews = 0
    correct_claim_decisions = 0
    
    # Validate document reviews
    for candidate_review in candidate_data['document_review']:
        for answer_review in answer_key_data['document_review']:
            if candidate_review['claim_id'] == answer_review['claim_id']:
                if (set(candidate_review['discrepancies']) == set(answer_review['discrepancies']) and
                    set(candidate_review['missing_information']) == set(answer_review['missing_information'])):
                    correct_document_reviews += 1
    
    # Validate claim decisions
    for candidate_decision in candidate_data['claim_decisions']:
        for answer_decision in answer_key_data['claim_decisions']:
            if candidate_decision['claim_id'] == answer_decision['claim_id']:
                if (candidate_decision['calculated_payable_amount'] == answer_decision['calculated_payable_amount'] and
                    candidate_decision['decision'] == answer_decision['decision'] and
                    candidate_decision['justification'] == answer_decision['justification']):
                    correct_claim_decisions += 1
    
    # Calculate accuracy
    document_review_accuracy = correct_document_reviews / len(answer_key_data['document_review'])
    claim_decision_accuracy = correct_claim_decisions / len(answer_key_data['claim_decisions'])
    
    # Determine pass/fail
    if document_review_accuracy >= 0.8 and claim_decision_accuracy >= 0.8:
        return ""Pass""
    else:
        return ""Fail""

# Example usage
candidate_json = '{""candidate_id"": ""EXAMPLE_ID"", ""document_review"": [...], ""claim_decisions"": [...]}'
answer_key_json = '{""candidate_id"": ""EXAMPLE_ID"", ""document_review"": [...], ""claim_decisions"": [...]}'
result = validate_submission(candidate_json, answer_key_json)
print(result)
```

This script checks each claim's document review and decision against the answer key, counting correct answers and calculating accuracy to determine if the candidate passes. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment

## Your assignment:
- If the exam doesn't require any additional material, just respond with ""No material required"".
- Else create synthetic test materials (CSV contents, datasets, etc.) that have predictable outcomes. Include the actual content to be provided to candidates and ensure all materials have clear identifiers, labels, or pre-defined categories that prevent ambiguity.

IMPORTANT: When designing the test, eliminate any opportunities for candidates to make arbitrary choices (like custom account codes, naming conventions, or classification systems) that would complicate evaluation. Either:
- Provide pre-defined structures/codes that must be used, or
- Design questions with objectively verifiable numerical/text answers that don't depend on the candidate's approach

        ""claim_id"": ""10002"",
        ""issue"": ""Missing policy number""
      },
      {
        ""claim_id"": ""10003"",
        ""issue"": ""Inconsistent date format""
      }
    ]
  },

        ""recommendation"": ""Adjust settlement to align with policy limits""
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers and How They Were Derived

**Task 1: Data Verification**

- **Claim ID 10001:** The claim amount was found to be incorrect when cross-referenced with the policy details or historical data.
- **Claim ID 10002:** The policy number was missing, which is a critical piece of information for claim processing.
- **Claim ID 10003:** The date format was inconsistent with the company's standard format, which could lead to processing errors.

**Task 2: Claims Analysis**

- **Claim ID 20001:** The claim was found to be valid as it met all the criteria outlined in the company guidelines, and the settlement amount was within the acceptable range.
- **Claim ID 20002:** The claim was invalid due to missing supporting documentation, which is necessary to substantiate the claim.
- **Claim ID 20003:** The claim was valid, but the settlement amount needed adjustment to comply with policy limits as per the guidelines.

### Passing Criteria

- **Task 1:** The candidate must correctly identify at least 2 out of 3 discrepancies to pass this task.
- **Task 2:** The candidate must correctly analyze at least 2 out of 3 claims, providing accurate validity status and appropriate recommendations.

### Programmatic Validation of Answers

To programmatically validate the candidate's answers, a script can be used to compare the candidate's JSON submission against the answer key. Below is a pseudo-code outline for such a validation script:

```python
def validate_submission(candidate_json, answer_key_json):
    # Load JSON data
    candidate_data = json.loads(candidate_json)
    answer_key_data = json.loads(answer_key_json)
    
    # Initialize counters
    task_1_correct = 0
    task_2_correct = 0
    
    # Validate Task 1
    for discrepancy in candidate_data['task_1']['discrepancies']:
        for answer in answer_key_data['task_1']['discrepancies']:
            if discrepancy['claim_id'] == answer['claim_id'] and discrepancy['issue'] == answer['issue']:
                task_1_correct += 1
                break
    
    # Validate Task 2
    for analysis in candidate_data['task_2']['analysis']:
        for answer in answer_key_data['task_2']['analysis']:
            if (analysis['claim_id'] == answer['claim_id'] and 
                analysis['validity'] == answer['validity'] and 
                analysis['recommendation'] == answer['recommendation']):
                task_2_correct += 1
                break
    
    # Determine pass/fail
    task_1_pass = task_1_correct >= 2
    task_2_pass = task_2_correct >= 2
    
    return task_1_pass and task_2_pass

# Example usage
candidate_json = '{""candidate_id"": ""GPT-4-turbo"", ""task_1"": {...}, ""task_2"": {...}}'
answer_key_json = '{""candidate_id"": ""Evaluator"", ""task_1"": {...}, ""task_2"": {...}}'
result = validate_submission(candidate_json, answer_key_json)
print(""Pass"" if result else ""Fail"")
```

This script checks each task's answers against the answer key and determines if the candidate passes based on the criteria specified.","

```

### Explanation of Correct Answers and How They Were Derived

**Task 1: Data Verification**

- **Claim ID 10001:** The claim amount was found to be incorrect when cross-referenced with the policy details or historical data.
- **Claim ID 10002:** The policy number was missing, which is a critical piece of information for claim processing.
- **Claim ID 10003:** The date format was inconsistent with the company's standard format, which could lead to processing errors.

**Task 2: Claims Analysis**

- **Claim ID 20001:** The claim was found to be valid as it met all the criteria outlined in the company guidelines, and the settlement amount was within the acceptable range.
- **Claim ID 20002:** The claim was invalid due to missing supporting documentation, which is necessary to substantiate the claim.
- **Claim ID 20003:** The claim was valid, but the settlement amount needed adjustment to comply with policy limits as per the guidelines.

### Passing Criteria

- **Task 1:** The candidate must correctly identify at least 2 out of 3 discrepancies to pass this task.
- **Task 2:** The candidate must correctly analyze at least 2 out of 3 claims, providing accurate validity status and appropriate recommendations.

### Programmatic Validation of Answers

To programmatically validate the candidate's answers, a script can be used to compare the candidate's JSON submission against the answer key. Below is a pseudo-code outline for such a validation script:

```python
def validate_submission(candidate_json, answer_key_json):
    # Load JSON data
    candidate_data = json.loads(candidate_json)
    answer_key_data = json.loads(answer_key_json)
    
    # Initialize counters
    task_1_correct = 0
    task_2_correct = 0
    
    # Validate Task 1
    for discrepancy in candidate_data['task_1']['discrepancies']:
        for answer in answer_key_data['task_1']['discrepancies']:
            if discrepancy['claim_id'] == answer['claim_id'] and discrepancy['issue'] == answer['issue']:
                task_1_correct += 1
                break
    
    # Validate Task 2
    for analysis in candidate_data['task_2']['analysis']:
        for answer in answer_key_data['task_2']['analysis']:
            if (analysis['claim_id'] == answer['claim_id'] and 
                analysis['validity'] == answer['validity'] and 
                analysis['recommendation'] == answer['recommendation']):
                task_2_correct += 1
                break
    
    # Determine pass/fail
    task_1_pass = task_1_correct >= 2
    task_2_pass = task_2_correct >= 2
    
    return task_1_pass and task_2_pass

# Example usage
candidate_json = '{""candidate_id"": ""GPT-4-turbo"", ""task_1"": {...}, ""task_2"": {...}}'
answer_key_json = '{""candidate_id"": ""Evaluator"", ""task_1"": {...}, ""task_2"": {...}}'
result = validate_submission(candidate_json, answer_key_json)
print(""Pass"" if result else ""Fail"")
```

This script checks each task's answers against the answer key and determines if the candidate passes based on the criteria specified. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","Below is a Python script named `task_evaluation.py` that reads the candidate's submission from `test_submission.json` and the answer key from `answer_key.json`. It evaluates the candidate's performance and saves the results in `test_results.json`, including an overall score as a percentage.

```python

### Explanation:
- **Loading JSON Files:** The script reads the candidate's submission and the answer key from JSON files.
- **Evaluation Functions:** Two functions, `evaluate_task_1` and `evaluate_task_2`, compare the candidate's answers to the answer key and count the number of correct answers.
- **Overall Score Calculation:** The `calculate_overall_score` function computes the overall score as a percentage of correct answers out of the total possible correct answers.
- **Results Output:** The results, including the number of correct answers for each task and the overall score, are saved to `test_results.json`.

This script provides a structured evaluation of the candidate's performance and outputs the results in a clear and concise format."

## Your assignment:
- If the exam doesn't require any additional material, just respond with ""No material required"".
- Else create synthetic test materials (CSV contents, datasets, etc.) that have predictable outcomes. Include the actual content to be provided to candidates and ensure all materials have clear identifiers, labels, or pre-defined categories that prevent ambiguity.

IMPORTANT: When designing the test, eliminate any opportunities for candidates to make arbitrary choices (like custom account codes, naming conventions, or classification systems) that would complicate evaluation. Either:
- Provide pre-defined structures/codes that must be used, or
- Design questions with objectively verifiable numerical/text answers that don't depend on the candidate's approach

### Explanation of Correct Answers

- **Task 1: Claim Analysis and Prioritization**
  - The prioritization is based on the severity and urgency of each claim. Claims involving severe injuries or significant property damage are prioritized higher due to their potential impact and need for immediate resolution.
  - The explanations provide a rationale for each prioritization decision, focusing on the nature of the claim and its implications.

- **Task 2: Resolution Strategy Development**
  - The steps outline a logical process for resolving a complex claim, starting from document review to negotiation.
  - Considerations ensure that the resolution process adheres to legal standards and maintains effective communication.
  - Challenges and solutions address common issues in claims handling, providing practical approaches to overcome them.

### Passing Criteria

- **Task 1:** The candidate must correctly prioritize at least 4 out of 5 claims and provide reasonable explanations for their prioritization.
- **Task 2:** The candidate must outline a coherent resolution strategy with at least 4 steps, 2 considerations, and 2 challenges with solutions.

### Programmatic Validation

To programmatically validate the answers, a script can be used to compare the candidate's JSON submission against the answer key. The script should:

1. Check if the prioritization order matches the answer key.
2. Verify that explanations are reasonable and align with the provided scenarios.
3. Ensure that the resolution strategy includes the required number of steps, considerations, and challenges with solutions.

Here is a simple validation script outline in Python:

```python
import json

def validate_submission(submission_file, answer_key_file):
    with open(submission_file, 'r') as sub_file, open(answer_key_file, 'r') as ans_file:
        submission = json.load(sub_file)
        answer_key = json.load(ans_file)['answer_key']
        
        # Validate Task 1
        task_1_correct = 0
        for sub, ans in zip(submission['task_1']['prioritization'], answer_key['task_1']['prioritization']):
            if sub['priority'] == ans['priority']:
                task_1_correct += 1
        
        # Validate Task 2
        task_2_correct = True
        sub_task_2 = submission['task_2']['resolution_strategy']
        ans_task_2 = answer_key['task_2']['resolution_strategy']
        
        if len(sub_task_2['steps']) < len(ans_task_2['steps']):
            task_2_correct = False
        if len(sub_task_2['considerations']) < len(ans_task_2['considerations']):
            task_2_correct = False
        if len(sub_task_2['challenges_and_solutions']) < len(ans_task_2['challenges_and_solutions']):
            task_2_correct = False
        
        # Determine pass/fail
        pass_task_1 = task_1_correct >= 4
        pass_task_2 = task_2_correct
        
        return pass_task_1 and pass_task_2

# Example usage
print(validate_submission('test_submission.json', 'answer_key.json'))
```

This script checks the prioritization and ensures the resolution strategy meets the minimum requirements. Adjustments can be made based on specific evaluation criteria.","

### Programmatic Validation

To programmatically validate the answers, a script can be used to compare the candidate's JSON submission against the answer key. The script should:

1. Check if the prioritization order matches the answer key.
2. Verify that explanations are reasonable and align with the provided scenarios.
3. Ensure that the resolution strategy includes the required number of steps, considerations, and challenges with solutions.

Here is a simple validation script outline in Python:

```python
import json

def validate_submission(submission_file, answer_key_file):
    with open(submission_file, 'r') as sub_file, open(answer_key_file, 'r') as ans_file:
        submission = json.load(sub_file)
        answer_key = json.load(ans_file)['answer_key']
        
        # Validate Task 1
        task_1_correct = 0
        for sub, ans in zip(submission['task_1']['prioritization'], answer_key['task_1']['prioritization']):
            if sub['priority'] == ans['priority']:
                task_1_correct += 1
        
        # Validate Task 2
        task_2_correct = True
        sub_task_2 = submission['task_2']['resolution_strategy']
        ans_task_2 = answer_key['task_2']['resolution_strategy']
        
        if len(sub_task_2['steps']) < len(ans_task_2['steps']):
            task_2_correct = False
        if len(sub_task_2['considerations']) < len(ans_task_2['considerations']):
            task_2_correct = False
        if len(sub_task_2['challenges_and_solutions']) < len(ans_task_2['challenges_and_solutions']):
            task_2_correct = False
        
        # Determine pass/fail
        pass_task_1 = task_1_correct >= 4
        pass_task_2 = task_2_correct
        
        return pass_task_1 and pass_task_2

# Example usage
print(validate_submission('test_submission.json', 'answer_key.json'))
```

This script checks the prioritization and ensures the resolution strategy meets the minimum requirements. Adjustments can be made based on specific evaluation criteria. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","Below is the Python script named `task_evaluation.py` that reads the candidate's submission from `test_submission.json` and the answer key from `answer_key.json`. It evaluates the candidate's performance and saves the results in `test_results.json`, including an `overall_score` as a percentage.

Here are the materials provided to the candidate: <materials> Here are the synthetic test materials for the basic practical exam:

### Materials Provided:

#### 1. Claims Dataset (claims_data.csv)

```csv
claim_id,claim_amount,current_reserve,claim_status,claim_type
C001,10000,8000,Open,Auto
C002,15000,12000,Open,Home
C003,20000,18000,Closed,Auto
C004,25000,20000,Open,Health
C005,30000,25000,Open,Auto
```

#### 2. Corporate Policies Document (corporate_policies.pdf)

**Corporate Policies for Reserve Adjustments:**

1. **General Guidelines:**
   - Reserves should be adjusted based on the claim status and type.
   - Closed claims do not require reserve adjustments.

2. **Reserve Adjustment Criteria:**
   - **Auto Claims:**
     - If the claim is open and the current reserve is less than 90% of the claim amount, adjust the reserve to 90% of the claim amount.
   - **Home Claims:**
     - If the claim is open and the current reserve is less than 85% of the claim amount, adjust the reserve to 85% of the claim amount.
   - **Health Claims:**
     - If the claim is open and the current reserve is less than 80% of the claim amount, adjust the reserve to 80% of the claim amount.

3. **Reserve Recommendation Scenario:**
   - For claims with a claim amount greater than $20,000, provide a reserve recommendation.
   - Recommendations should consider potential future liabilities and align with the above criteria.

**Example Scenario for Reserve Recommendations:**
- Claim C004 (Health) has a claim amount of $25,000. The current reserve is $20,000. Based on the policy, the reserve should be adjusted to 80% of the claim amount, which is $20,000. However, given the potential for future medical expenses, a recommendation to increase the reserve to $22,000 is suggested.

  }
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

1. **Adjusted Reserves:**
   - **C001 (Auto):** Current reserve is $8,000, which is less than 90% of the claim amount ($10,000). Adjust to 90% of $10,000 = $9,000.
   - **C002 (Home):** Current reserve is $12,000, which is less than 85% of the claim amount ($15,000). Adjust to 85% of $15,000 = $12,750.
   - **C003 (Auto):** Claim is closed, so no adjustment is needed. The reserve remains $18,000.
   - **C004 (Health):** Current reserve is $20,000, which is already 80% of the claim amount ($25,000). No adjustment needed, but recommendation is to increase due to potential future expenses.
   - **C005 (Auto):** Current reserve is $25,000, which is less than 90% of the claim amount ($30,000). Adjust to 90% of $30,000 = $27,000.

2. **Reserve Recommendation Report:**
   - **C004:** Recommend increasing the reserve to $22,000 due to potential future medical expenses, even though the current reserve meets the policy criteria.
   - **C005:** Maintain the reserve at 90% of the claim amount, which is $27,000, as per policy.

### Passing Criteria

- The candidate must correctly adjust reserves for at least 4 out of 5 claims.
- The candidate must provide a reasonable justification for at least one reserve recommendation, aligning with corporate policies.

### Programmatic Validation

To programmatically validate the answers, you can use the following logic:

1. **Adjusted Reserves Validation:**
   - For each claim, check if the `adjusted_reserve` matches the calculated reserve based on the policy:
     - Auto: 90% of claim amount if open.
     - Home: 85% of claim amount if open.
     - Health: 80% of claim amount if open.
   - Closed claims should not have adjusted reserves.

2. **Reserve Recommendation Validation:**
   - Check if the `recommended_reserve` for claims with amounts greater than $20,000 aligns with the policy and includes a reasonable justification.

Here is a simple Python script to validate the JSON submission:

```python
import json

def validate_submission(submission):
    correct_reserves = {
        ""C001"": 9000,
        ""C002"": 12750,
        ""C003"": 18000,
        ""C004"": 20000,
        ""C005"": 27000
    }
    
    correct_recommendations = {
        ""C004"": 22000,
        ""C005"": 27000
    }
    
    # Load the submission
    with open(submission, 'r') as file:
        data = json.load(file)
    
    # Validate adjusted reserves
    adjusted_reserves = data.get(""adjusted_reserves"", [])
    reserve_correct_count = 0
    for reserve in adjusted_reserves:
        claim_id = reserve[""claim_id""]
        adjusted_reserve = reserve[""adjusted_reserve""]
        if correct_reserves.get(claim_id) == adjusted_reserve:
            reserve_correct_count += 1
    
    # Validate recommendations
    recommendations = data.get(""reserve_recommendation_report"", {}).get(""recommendations"", [])
    recommendation_correct_count = 0
    for recommendation in recommendations:
        claim_id = recommendation[""claim_id""]
        recommended_reserve = recommendation[""recommended_reserve""]
        if correct_recommendations.get(claim_id) == recommended_reserve:
            recommendation_correct_count += 1
    
    # Check passing criteria
    if reserve_correct_count >= 4 and recommendation_correct_count >= 1:
        return ""Pass""
    else:
        return ""Fail""

# Example usage
result = validate_submission(""test_submission.json"")
print(result)
```

  }
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

1. **Adjusted Reserves:**
   - **C001 (Auto):** Current reserve is $8,000, which is less than 90% of the claim amount ($10,000). Adjust to 90% of $10,000 = $9,000.
   - **C002 (Home):** Current reserve is $12,000, which is less than 85% of the claim amount ($15,000). Adjust to 85% of $15,000 = $12,750.
   - **C003 (Auto):** Claim is closed, so no adjustment is needed. The reserve remains $18,000.
   - **C004 (Health):** Current reserve is $20,000, which is already 80% of the claim amount ($25,000). No adjustment needed, but recommendation is to increase due to potential future expenses.
   - **C005 (Auto):** Current reserve is $25,000, which is less than 90% of the claim amount ($30,000). Adjust to 90% of $30,000 = $27,000.

2. **Reserve Recommendation Report:**
   - **C004:** Recommend increasing the reserve to $22,000 due to potential future medical expenses, even though the current reserve meets the policy criteria.
   - **C005:** Maintain the reserve at 90% of the claim amount, which is $27,000, as per policy.

### Passing Criteria

- The candidate must correctly adjust reserves for at least 4 out of 5 claims.
- The candidate must provide a reasonable justification for at least one reserve recommendation, aligning with corporate policies.

### Programmatic Validation

To programmatically validate the answers, you can use the following logic:

1. **Adjusted Reserves Validation:**
   - For each claim, check if the `adjusted_reserve` matches the calculated reserve based on the policy:
     - Auto: 90% of claim amount if open.
     - Home: 85% of claim amount if open.
     - Health: 80% of claim amount if open.
   - Closed claims should not have adjusted reserves.

2. **Reserve Recommendation Validation:**
   - Check if the `recommended_reserve` for claims with amounts greater than $20,000 aligns with the policy and includes a reasonable justification.

Here is a simple Python script to validate the JSON submission:

```python
import json

def validate_submission(submission):
    correct_reserves = {
        ""C001"": 9000,
        ""C002"": 12750,
        ""C003"": 18000,
        ""C004"": 20000,
        ""C005"": 27000
    }
    
    correct_recommendations = {
        ""C004"": 22000,
        ""C005"": 27000
    }
    
    # Load the submission
    with open(submission, 'r') as file:
        data = json.load(file)
    
    # Validate adjusted reserves
    adjusted_reserves = data.get(""adjusted_reserves"", [])
    reserve_correct_count = 0
    for reserve in adjusted_reserves:
        claim_id = reserve[""claim_id""]
        adjusted_reserve = reserve[""adjusted_reserve""]
        if correct_reserves.get(claim_id) == adjusted_reserve:
            reserve_correct_count += 1
    
    # Validate recommendations
    recommendations = data.get(""reserve_recommendation_report"", {}).get(""recommendations"", [])
    recommendation_correct_count = 0
    for recommendation in recommendations:
        claim_id = recommendation[""claim_id""]
        recommended_reserve = recommendation[""recommended_reserve""]
        if correct_recommendations.get(claim_id) == recommended_reserve:
            recommendation_correct_count += 1
    
    # Check passing criteria
    if reserve_correct_count >= 4 and recommendation_correct_count >= 1:
        return ""Pass""
    else:
        return ""Fail""

# Example usage
result = validate_submission(""test_submission.json"")
print(result)
```

This script checks the adjusted reserves and recommendations against the correct values and determines if the candidate passes based on the criteria. </evaluation_information>

    }
  ],
  ""discrepancies"": [
    ""Claim ID C104 has inconsistent settlement dates."",
    ""Claim ID C105 is missing a claimant name.""
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

1. **Settled Claims Summary**:
   - **Total Number of Claims**: This is the count of all claims listed in the `settled_claims.xlsx` file.
   - **Total Settlement Amount**: This is the sum of all settlement amounts listed in the spreadsheet.
   - **Average Settlement Amount**: This is calculated by dividing the total settlement amount by the total number of claims.

2. **Claims Inventory**:
   - **Claim ID**: Each claim from the `claims_inventory.pdf` should be listed with its unique identifier.
   - **Status**: Each claim should be categorized into one of the predefined statuses: ""Pending"", ""Under Review"", or ""Completed"".
   - **Missing Information**: Any missing details that are critical for processing the claim should be noted. If no information is missing, this should be `null`.

3. **Discrepancies**:
   - Any inconsistencies or errors found in the claims data should be documented. This includes mismatched dates, missing names, or any other anomalies.

### Passing Criteria

To pass the basic exam, the candidate must:

- Correctly calculate and report the total number of claims, total settlement amount, and average settlement amount.
- Accurately categorize at least 80% of the claims in the inventory with the correct status.
- Identify and document at least 80% of the discrepancies present in the claims data.

### Validation Formula or Script

To programmatically validate the answers, a script can be used to compare the candidate's JSON submission against the answer key. Here is a simple validation approach in pseudocode:

```pseudocode
function validateSubmission(candidateSubmission, answerKey):
    score = 0
    maxScore = 5  // Total number of checks

    // Check Settled Claims Summary
    if candidateSubmission.settled_claims_summary == answerKey.settled_claims_summary:
        score += 1

    // Check Claims Inventory
    correctClaims = 0
    for claim in candidateSubmission.claims_inventory:
        if claim in answerKey.claims_inventory:
            correctClaims += 1
    if correctClaims / length(answerKey.claims_inventory) >= 0.8:
        score += 1

    // Check Discrepancies
    correctDiscrepancies = 0
    for discrepancy in candidateSubmission.discrepancies:
        if discrepancy in answerKey.discrepancies:
            correctDiscrepancies += 1
    if correctDiscrepancies / length(answerKey.discrepancies) >= 0.8:
        score += 1

    // Determine Pass/Fail
    if score >= 3:
        return ""Pass""
    else:
        return ""Fail""
```

This script checks the candidate's submission against the answer key and calculates a score based on the accuracy of their answers. A score of 3 or higher indicates a passing result.","

This script checks the candidate's submission against the answer key and calculates a score based on the accuracy of their answers. A score of 3 or higher indicates a passing result. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","Below is a Python script named `task_evaluation.py` that reads the candidate's submission from `test_submission.json` and the answer key from `answer_key.json`. It evaluates the candidate's performance and saves the results in `test_results.json`.

```python
import json

def load_json(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

def calculate_score(candidate_submission, answer_key):
    score_details = {
        ""settled_claims_summary_correct"": False,
        ""claims_inventory_correct"": False,
        ""discrepancies_correct"": False
    }
    total_checks = 3
    score = 0

    # Check Settled Claims Summary
    if candidate_submission[""settled_claims_summary""] == answer_key[""settled_claims_summary""]:
        score_details[""settled_claims_summary_correct""] = True

    for claim in candidate_submission[""claims_inventory""]:
        if claim in answer_key[""claims_inventory""]:
            correct_claims += 1
    if correct_claims / len(answer_key[""claims_inventory""]) >= 0.8:
        score_details[""claims_inventory_correct""] = True
        score += 1

    # Check Discrepancies
    correct_discrepancies = 0
    for discrepancy in candidate_submission[""discrepancies""]:
        if discrepancy in answer_key[""discrepancies""]:
            correct_discrepancies += 1
    if correct_discrepancies / len(answer_key[""discrepancies""]) >= 0.8:
        score_details[""discrepancies_correct""] = True
        score += 1

    overall_score = (score / total_checks) * 100
    return score_details, overall_score

def save_results(score_details, overall_score):
    results = {
        ""score_details"": score_details,
        ""overall_score"": overall_score
    }
    with open('test_results.json', 'w') as file:
        json.dump(results, file, indent=4)

def main():
    candidate_submission = load_json('test_submission.json')
    answer_key = load_json('answer_key.json')
    score_details, overall_score = calculate_score(candidate_submission, answer_key)
    save_results(score_details, overall_score)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Script

1. **Loading JSON Files**: The `load_json` function reads a JSON file and returns its content as a Python dictionary.

2. **Calculating the Score**: The `calculate_score` function compares the candidate's submission against the answer key. It checks:
   - If the settled claims summary matches exactly.
   - If at least 80% of the claims in the inventory are correctly categorized.
   - If at least 80% of the discrepancies are correctly identified.

3. **Saving Results**: The `save_results` function writes the detailed score and overall score to `test_results.json`.

4. **Main Function**: The `main` function orchestrates the loading of data, calculation of scores, and saving of results.

### Usage

- Place `task_evaluation.py`, `test_submission.json`, and `answer_key.json` in the same directory.
- Run the script using a Python interpreter: `python task_evaluation.py`.
- The results will be saved in `test_results.json` in the same directory."

   - **Questionable Claims:** The script compares each claim ID and reason from the candidate's submission against the answer key. It counts the number of correct identifications.
   - **Referral Report:** It checks if the claim ID, summary, and additional information in the candidate's referral report match those in the answer key.

3. **Scoring:**
   - The script calculates the overall score as a percentage of correctly identified claims and a correct referral report.

4. **Saving Results:** The results, including detailed feedback and the overall score, are saved to `test_results.json`.

This script provides a structured and automated way to evaluate the candidate's performance on the practical exam."

- Complete answer key in JSON format for automated checking
- Explanation of correct answers and how they were derived
- Passing criteria (e.g., minimum number of correct answers)
- If there are multiple valid solution approaches, provide a way to programmatically validate answers (e.g., a validation formula or script)
","### Answer Key for Automated Checking

Below is a sample answer key in JSON format that can be used for automated checking. This key assumes a hypothetical dataset and provides an example of what correct answers might look like:

```json
{
  ""candidate_id"": ""GPT-4-turbo"",
  ""irregularities"": [
    {
      ""claim_id"": ""10001"",
      ""description"": ""Overpayment: Paid Amount exceeds Billed Amount""
    },
    {
      ""claim_id"": ""10002"",
      ""description"": ""Underpayment: Paid Amount is less than Billed Amount""
    },
    {
      ""claim_id"": ""10003"",
      ""description"": ""Irregularity: Paid status with zero Paid Amount""
    }
  ],
  ""summary"": {
    ""total_overpayments"": 1,
    ""total_underpayments"": 1,
    ""total_other_irregularities"": 1
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

1. **Irregularities Identification:**
   - **Overpayment:** This occurs when the ""Paid Amount"" is greater than the ""Billed Amount"". For example, if a claim with ID ""10001"" has a Billed Amount of $100 and a Paid Amount of $120, it is an overpayment.
   - **Underpayment:** This occurs when the ""Paid Amount"" is less than the ""Billed Amount"". For example, if a claim with ID ""10002"" has a Billed Amount of $150 and a Paid Amount of $100, it is an underpayment.
   - **Other Irregularities:** These include any other inconsistencies, such as a ""Paid"" status with a Paid Amount of zero. For example, if a claim with ID ""10003"" has a ""Paid"" status but a Paid Amount of $0, it is an irregularity.

2. **Summary Section:**
   - The summary should accurately reflect the total counts of each type of irregularity identified in the dataset. In the example, there is 1 overpayment, 1 underpayment, and 1 other irregularity.

### Passing Criteria

- **Minimum Correct Answers:** To pass, the candidate must correctly identify at least 80% of the irregularities in the dataset and provide an accurate summary.
- **JSON Structure:** The JSON file must be correctly formatted without syntax errors.

### Validation Formula or Script

To programmatically validate the answers, a script can be used to compare the candidate's submission against the answer key. Below is a pseudo-code example of how this validation might be implemented:

```python
def validate_submission(candidate_json, answer_key_json):
    # Load JSON data
    candidate_data = json.loads(candidate_json)
    answer_key_data = json.loads(answer_key_json)
    
    # Check candidate ID
    if candidate_data[""candidate_id""] != answer_key_data[""candidate_id""]:
        return False, ""Incorrect candidate ID""
    
    # Validate irregularities
    candidate_irregularities = candidate_data[""irregularities""]
    answer_irregularities = answer_key_data[""irregularities""]
    
    correct_irregularities = 0
    for candidate_irregularity in candidate_irregularities:
        if candidate_irregularity in answer_irregularities:
            correct_irregularities += 1
    
    # Calculate accuracy
    accuracy = correct_irregularities / len(answer_irregularities)
    
    # Validate summary
    candidate_summary = candidate_data[""summary""]
    answer_summary = answer_key_data[""summary""]
    
    summary_correct = (
        candidate_summary[""total_overpayments""] == answer_summary[""total_overpayments""] and
        candidate_summary[""total_underpayments""] == answer_summary[""total_underpayments""] and
        candidate_summary[""total_other_irregularities""] == answer_summary[""total_other_irregularities""]
    )
    
    # Determine pass/fail
    if accuracy >= 0.8 and summary_correct:
        return True, ""Pass""
    else:
        return False, ""Fail""

# Example usage
candidate_json = '{""candidate_id"": ""GPT-4-turbo"", ""irregularities"": [...], ""summary"": {...}}'
answer_key_json = '{""candidate_id"": ""GPT-4-turbo"", ""irregularities"": [...], ""summary"": {...}}'
result, message = validate_submission(candidate_json, answer_key_json)
print(message)
```

This script checks the candidate's JSON against the answer key, ensuring that the irregularities and summary are correctly identified and reported.","

Here is the information given to the evaluator: <evaluation_information> ### Answer Key for Automated Checking

Below is a sample answer key in JSON format that can be used for automated checking. This key assumes a hypothetical dataset and provides an example of what correct answers might look like:

```json
{
  ""candidate_id"": ""GPT-4-turbo"",
  ""irregularities"": [
    {
      ""claim_id"": ""10001"",
      ""description"": ""Overpayment: Paid Amount exceeds Billed Amount""
    },
    {
      ""claim_id"": ""10002"",

  ],
  ""summary"": {
    ""total_overpayments"": 1,
    ""total_underpayments"": 1,
    ""total_other_irregularities"": 1
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Correct Answers

1. **Irregularities Identification:**
   - **Overpayment:** This occurs when the ""Paid Amount"" is greater than the ""Billed Amount"". For example, if a claim with ID ""10001"" has a Billed Amount of $100 and a Paid Amount of $120, it is an overpayment.
   - **Underpayment:** This occurs when the ""Paid Amount"" is less than the ""Billed Amount"". For example, if a claim with ID ""10002"" has a Billed Amount of $150 and a Paid Amount of $100, it is an underpayment.
   - **Other Irregularities:** These include any other inconsistencies, such as a ""Paid"" status with a Paid Amount of zero. For example, if a claim with ID ""10003"" has a ""Paid"" status but a Paid Amount of $0, it is an irregularity.

2. **Summary Section:**
   - The summary should accurately reflect the total counts of each type of irregularity identified in the dataset. In the example, there is 1 overpayment, 1 underpayment, and 1 other irregularity.

### Passing Criteria

- **Minimum Correct Answers:** To pass, the candidate must correctly identify at least 80% of the irregularities in the dataset and provide an accurate summary.
- **JSON Structure:** The JSON file must be correctly formatted without syntax errors.

### Validation Formula or Script

To programmatically validate the answers, a script can be used to compare the candidate's submission against the answer key. Below is a pseudo-code example of how this validation might be implemented:

```python
def validate_submission(candidate_json, answer_key_json):
    # Load JSON data
    candidate_data = json.loads(candidate_json)
    answer_key_data = json.loads(answer_key_json)
    
    # Check candidate ID
    if candidate_data[""candidate_id""] != answer_key_data[""candidate_id""]:
        return False, ""Incorrect candidate ID""
    
    # Validate irregularities
    candidate_irregularities = candidate_data[""irregularities""]
    answer_irregularities = answer_key_data[""irregularities""]
    
    correct_irregularities = 0
    for candidate_irregularity in candidate_irregularities:
        if candidate_irregularity in answer_irregularities:
            correct_irregularities += 1
    
    # Calculate accuracy
    accuracy = correct_irregularities / len(answer_irregularities)
    
    # Validate summary
    candidate_summary = candidate_data[""summary""]
    answer_summary = answer_key_data[""summary""]
    
    summary_correct = (
        candidate_summary[""total_overpayments""] == answer_summary[""total_overpayments""] and
        candidate_summary[""total_underpayments""] == answer_summary[""total_underpayments""] and
        candidate_summary[""total_other_irregularities""] == answer_summary[""total_other_irregularities""]
    )
    
    # Determine pass/fail
    if accuracy >= 0.8 and summary_correct:
        return True, ""Pass""
    else:
        return False, ""Fail""

# Example usage
candidate_json = '{""candidate_id"": ""GPT-4-turbo"", ""irregularities"": [...], ""summary"": {...}}'
answer_key_json = '{""candidate_id"": ""GPT-4-turbo"", ""irregularities"": [...], ""summary"": {...}}'
result, message = validate_submission(candidate_json, answer_key_json)
print(message)
```

This script checks the candidate's JSON against the answer key, ensuring that the irregularities and summary are correctly identified and reported. </evaluation_information>

## Your assignment
Based on the given information create a python script named 'task_evaluation.py' that reads in the candidate submission ('test_submission.json') and reads in the answer key ('answer_key.json') provided, placed in the same folder as 'task_evaluation.py'.
Then the script should automatically score the test performance and save the result as 'test_results.json' in the same folder. 
In addition to the detailed test results, 'test_results.json' should include one variable 'overall_score' with the percentage of points achieved by the candidate.

","Below is a Python script named `task_evaluation.py` that reads the candidate's submission from `test_submission.json` and the answer key from `answer_key.json`. It evaluates the candidate's performance and saves the results in `test_results.json`, including an `overall_score` representing the percentage of points achieved.

```python
import json

def load_json(file_path):
    """"""Load JSON data from a file.""""""
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

def evaluate_submission(candidate_data, answer_key_data):
    """"""Evaluate the candidate's submission against the answer key.""""""
    results = {
        ""correct_irregularities"": 0,
        ""total_irregularities"": len(answer_key_data[""irregularities""]),
        ""summary_correct"": False,
        ""overall_score"": 0
    }
    
    # Check candidate ID
    if candidate_data[""candidate_id""] != answer_key_data[""candidate_id""]:
        results[""overall_score""] = 0
        return results

    # Validate irregularities
    candidate_irregularities = candidate_data[""irregularities""]
    answer_irregularities = answer_key_data[""irregularities""]
    
    for candidate_irregularity in candidate_irregularities:
        if candidate_irregularity in answer_irregularities:
            results[""correct_irregularities""] += 1
    
    # Calculate accuracy
    accuracy = results[""correct_irregularities""] / results[""total_irregularities""]
    
    # Validate summary
    candidate_summary = candidate_data[""summary""]
    answer_summary = answer_key_data[""summary""]
    
    results[""summary_correct""] = (
        candidate_summary[""total_overpayments""] == answer_summary[""total_overpayments""] and
        candidate_summary[""total_underpayments""] == answer_summary[""total_underpayments""] and
        candidate_summary[""total_other_irregularities""] == answer_summary[""total_other_irregularities""]
    )
    
    # Determine overall score
    if results[""summary_correct""]:
        results[""overall_score""] = accuracy * 100
    else:
        results[""overall_score""] = accuracy * 50  # Penalize for incorrect summary
    
    return results

def save_results(results, file_path):
    """"""Save the evaluation results to a JSON file.""""""
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        json.dump(results, file, indent=4)

def main():
    # Load candidate submission and answer key
    candidate_data = load_json('test_submission.json')
    answer_key_data = load_json('answer_key.json')
    
    # Evaluate the submission
    results = evaluate_submission(candidate_data, answer_key_data)
    
    # Save the results
    save_results(results, 'test_results.json')

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
- **Loading JSON Data:** The script uses a helper function `load_json` to read JSON data from files.
- **Evaluation Logic:** The `evaluate_submission` function compares the candidate's submission against the answer key. It checks for correct irregularities and validates the summary.
- **Scoring:** The script calculates the `overall_score` based on the accuracy of identified irregularities and whether the summary is correct. If the summary is incorrect, the score is penalized.
- **Saving Results:** The results, including the `overall_score`, are saved to `test_results.json`.

### Usage:
1. Place `task_evaluation.py`, `test_submission.json`, and `answer_key.json` in the same directory.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter: `python task_evaluation.py`.
3. The results will be saved in `test_results.json`."
