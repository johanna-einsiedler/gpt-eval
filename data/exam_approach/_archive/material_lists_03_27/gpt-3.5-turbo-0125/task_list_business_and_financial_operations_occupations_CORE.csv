Task ID: 12865.0

Your assignment is to determine if it is possible to design a meaningful exam for this task that can be performed remotely and to identify the required tools and materials for the evaluation. 

**Definitions:**
- **Tools:** Software or applications (e.g., coding languages, code editor, spreadsheets, text editor, presentation software, image generator), that the candidate needs to use to complete the test.
- **Materials:** Digital content (e.g., data files, PDFs, images, audio files, virtual lab environments) that form part of the test content.

**Instructions:**
1. **Remote Feasibility:**  
   Evaluate whether the task can be performed online/remotely or if it requires in-person presence.
   - **If in-person required:** Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": false` and set all other fields (tools and materials) to `""NA""`.
   - **If remote:** Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": true` and continue with the evaluation.

2. **Tools Required:**  
   For each tool, assess whether it is needed for the task (Collect fees, commissions, or other payments, according to contract terms.) for the role of Agents and Business Managers of Artists, Performers, and Athletes. Options are: ""Required"" or ""Not Required"". The tools include:
   - ""Coding""
   - ""Spreadsheets""

Your assignment is to determine if it is possible to design a meaningful exam for this task that can be performed remotely and to identify the required tools and materials for the evaluation. 

**Definitions:**
- **Tools:** Software or applications (e.g., coding languages, code editor, spreadsheets, text editor, presentation software, image generator), that the candidate needs to use to complete the test.
- **Materials:** Digital content (e.g., data files, PDFs, images, audio files, virtual lab environments) that form part of the test content.

**Instructions:**
1. **Remote Feasibility:**  
   Evaluate whether the task can be performed online/remotely or if it requires in-person presence.
   - **If in-person required:** Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": false` and set all other fields (tools and materials) to `""NA""`.
   - **If remote:** Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": true` and continue with the evaluation.

2. **Tools Required:**  
   For each tool, assess whether it is needed for the task (Enter claim payments, reserves and new claims on computer system, inputting concise yet sufficient file documentation.) for the role of Claims Adjusters, Examiners, and Investigators. Options are: ""Required"" or ""Not Required"". The tools include:

Task ID: 21439.0

Your assignment is to determine if it is possible to design a meaningful exam for this task that can be performed remotely and to identify the required tools and materials for the evaluation. 

**Definitions:**
- **Tools:** Software or applications (e.g., coding languages, code editor, spreadsheets, text editor, presentation software, image generator), that the candidate needs to use to complete the test.
- **Materials:** Digital content (e.g., data files, PDFs, images, audio files, virtual lab environments) that form part of the test content.

**Instructions:**
1. **Remote Feasibility:**  
   Evaluate whether the task can be performed online/remotely or if it requires in-person presence.
   - **If in-person required:** Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": false` and set all other fields (tools and materials) to `""NA""`.
   - **If remote:** Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": true` and continue with the evaluation.

2. **Tools Required:**  
   For each tool, assess whether it is needed for the task (Report overpayments, underpayments, and other irregularities.) for the role of Claims Adjusters, Examiners, and Investigators. Options are: ""Required"" or ""Not Required"". The tools include:
   - ""Coding""
   - ""Spreadsheets""
   - ""Text editor""
   - ""PDF viewer""
   - ""Presentation software""
   - ""Image Generator""
   - ""Web Browser""
   - ""Other"" (specify tool name and classification if needed; otherwise ""NA"")

3. **Materials Required:**  
   For each material, determine if it is necessary as part of the test to evaluate Claims Adjusters, Examiners, and Investigators's ability to perform the task (Report overpayments, underpayments, and other irregularities.). Options are: ""Required""or ""Not required"" The materials include:
   - ""Text""
   - ""Data""
   - ""Images""
   - ""Audio files""
   - ""Video files""
   - ""Virtual labs or sandbox environments""
   - ""Other"" (specify material name and classification if needed; otherwise ""NA"")

4. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**  
   Optionally, include a brief chain-of-thought explanation (no more than 150 words) for your evaluations in a field called `""chain_of_thought""`.

**Output Requirement:**  
Return a JSON object strictly adhering to the provided structure, without any extra commentary outside of the JSON fields.
