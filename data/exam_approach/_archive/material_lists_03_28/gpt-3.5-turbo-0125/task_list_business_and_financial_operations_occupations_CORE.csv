Your assignment is to determine if it is possible to design a meaningful, **practical** exam for this task that can be performed remotely and to identify the required tools and materials for the evaluation. 

**Definitions:**
- **Tools:** Software or applications (e.g., coding languages, code editor, spreadsheets, text editor, presentation software, image generator), that the candidate needs to use to complete the test.
- **Materials:** Digital content (e.g., data files, PDFs, images, audio files, virtual lab environments) that form part of the test content.
- **Practical exam:** A practical exam is a an exam actually testing whether the described task can be performed successfully. An exam testing the knowledge about the task is NOT a practical exam.

**Instructions:**
1. **Remote Feasibility:**  
   Evaluate whether the task can be performed online/remotely or if it requires in-person presence.
   - **If in-person required:** Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": false` and set all other fields (tools and materials) to `""NA""`.
   - **If remote:** Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": true` and continue with the evaluation.
