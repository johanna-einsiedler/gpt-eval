Total cost: 25,000 kg × $2.85/kg = $71,250. Supplier Y: Minimum order 2,000 kg, can order 4,000 kg monthly (or 6 orders in 6 months = 24,000 kg). Total cost: 24,000 kg × $3.15/kg = $75,600.

A ratio below 1.0 indicates potential cash flow problems that could disrupt operations and lead to delivery delays, while a healthy ratio (typically 1.5-3.0) suggests the supplier can reliably fund ongoing operations and respond to unexpected challenges."

A high ratio indicates heavy reliance on debt financing, which may limit the supplier's ability to invest in equipment, R&D, or quality improvements. It also increases vulnerability to interest rate changes and economic downturns, potentially affecting long-term operational stability."

Consistently increasing DPO may indicate cash flow problems, while extremely short DPO might suggest inefficient cash management. By analyzing this metric alongside other payment patterns, you can assess whether the supplier maintains healthy relationships with their own supply chain, which directly impacts their ability to deliver consistently to you."
