        {
            "question_number": 1,
            "selected_option": "a",
            "justification": "Supplier A offers the best balance of price, delivery time, and warranty. While Supplier B has a lower unit price, their longer delivery time and shorter warranty period reduce overall value. Supplier A's 30-day delivery is reasonable, and the 2-year warranty provides better long-term protection than Supplier B's offering."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 2,
            "selected_option": "b",
            "justification": "The shipment has minor issues that don't warrant complete rejection but do justify a discount. The functional pass rate is high (98.5%), and the lifespan exceeds requirements, but the MTBF is slightly below industry standard and there are some cosmetic defects. A 5% discount appropriately addresses these quality concerns while maintaining the business relationship."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 3,
            "selected_option": "b",
            "justification": "Using the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) formula: √(2DS/H), where D=24,000 units annually, S=$150 ordering cost, and H=$5 holding cost (20% of $25), the calculation yields 1,549 units. This quantity minimizes the sum of ordering and holding costs, making it the most economical order quantity for the given parameters."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 4,
            "selected_option": "b",
            "justification": "For critical components where consistent quality and reliable delivery are paramount, Supplier Y is the best choice. They have the highest on-time delivery rate (99%), acceptable quality compliance (96%), and the best financial stability rating (A-). These factors outweigh their slightly higher price index because reliability is the stated priority for this critical component."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 5,
            "selected_option": "c",
            "justification": "The term '2/10 net 30' means a 2% discount if paid within 10 days, otherwise full payment in 30 days. The annualized savings percentage is calculated as: 2% × (360/(30-10)) = 2% × 18 = 36%. This represents the annualized value of taking the early payment discount consistently throughout the year."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 6,
            "selected_option": "b",
            "justification": "The supplier's offer constitutes an unethical attempt to influence the procurement decision and could be considered a bribe. The appropriate action is to decline the offer and report it to your supervisor immediately. Accepting such an offer would violate procurement ethics and potentially company policies, creating conflicts of interest."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 7,
            "selected_option": "a",
            "justification": "Option 1 costs: 10,000 × $5.75 × 0.97 = $55,775. Option 2 costs: (7,500 × $5.90) + (2,500 × $5.95) = $44,250 + $14,875 = $59,125. Option 1 provides a lower total cost by $3,350, primarily due to the volume discount that more than offsets the slightly higher per-unit price for the entire order."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 8,
            "selected_option": "c",
            "justification": "The situation presents multiple serious risks: political instability, high capacity utilization, increased shipping times, and single-sourcing. Implementing both increased safety stock and alternative supplier qualification provides immediate protection against short-term disruptions while developing a long-term solution. This comprehensive approach addresses both immediate and future supply chain risks."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 9,
            "selected_option": "b",
            "justification": "With weekly usage of 800 units and a minimum order quantity of 3,000 units, ordering every 4 weeks (3,000 ÷ 800 = 3.75 weeks) is optimal. This balances holding costs with the need to use inventory before its 6-month shelf life expires. Ordering every 3 weeks would require more frequent orders, while longer intervals would increase holding costs unnecessarily."
        },
        {
            "question_number": 10,
            "selected_option": "b",
            "justification": "Supplier profit margin is confidential supplier information that would not typically be included in a standard purchase order. Purchase orders normally include payment terms, delivery timeframes, and quality specifications, but the supplier's internal cost structure and profit margins remain proprietary to the supplier and are not documented in purchase orders."
