        "reasoning": "I calculated the number of cases by dividing the requested weight by the case weight and rounding up to the nearest whole case. For Red Delicious and Gala apples, 8,500 lbs / 42 lbs = 202.38 → 203 cases, and 7,200 lbs / 42 lbs = 171.43 → 172 cases. For Granny Smith, 5,300 lbs / 38 lbs = 139.47 → 140 cases.",

Supplier A provides 12,000 lbs at $0.82/lb, and Supplier B provides 6,500 lbs at $0.78/lb. Supplier C was excluded due to insufficient solids content.",
