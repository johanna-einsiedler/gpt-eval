        "requiredProducts": [
            {
                "product": "Red Delicious apples",
                "quantity": 203,
                "unit": "cases"
            },
            {
                "product": "Gala apples",
                "quantity": 172,
                "unit": "cases"
            },
            {
                "product": "Granny Smith apples",
                "quantity": 140,
                "unit": "cases"
            }
        ],
        "reasoning": "To determine the number of cases, I divided the required pounds for each apple variety by the weight per case and rounded up to the nearest whole number since only full cases can be ordered. For Red Delicious: 8500 lbs / 42 lbs/case = 202.38 cases, rounded to 203 cases. For Gala: 7200 lbs / 42 lbs/case = 171.43 cases, rounded to 172 cases. For Granny Smith: 5300 lbs / 38 lbs/case = 139.47 cases, rounded to 140 cases.",
        "additionalNotes": "Ordering in full cases will result in slightly more apples than the exact order quantity, but this is necessary to meet supplier requirements and avoid under-ordering. The excess should be manageable within typical grocery inventory fluctuations."

    "question2": {
        "requiredProducts": [
            {
                "product": "Roma tomatoes from Supplier B",
                "quantity": 9000,

                "unit": "lbs"
            }
        ],
        "reasoning": "I prioritized suppliers based on cost and specification compliance. Supplier C was excluded due to not meeting the 6.2% solids content requirement. Supplier B offers the lowest price ($0.78/lb) and meets the specification, so I ordered their maximum available quantity of 9,000 lbs. The remaining 9,500 lbs (18,500 lbs total - 9,000 lbs from Supplier B) were ordered from Supplier A, which is the next lowest cost supplier meeting specifications.",
        "additionalNotes": "This sourcing strategy ensures the lowest total cost while adhering to the quality specifications for solids content. Utilizing both Supplier A and B is necessary to fulfill the total quantity required as Supplier B alone cannot meet the 18,500 lbs demand."

    "question3": {
        "requiredProducts": [
            {
                "product": "Organic corn feed from primary supplier",
                "quantity": 40,
                "unit": "tons"

            {
                "product": "Organic corn feed from secondary supplier",
                "quantity": 25,
                "unit": "tons"
            }
        ],
        "reasoning": "Total demand is 28 + 16 + 35 = 79 tons. With 14 tons in inventory, we need to order 79 - 14 = 65 tons. To minimize lead time and ensure timely delivery, I prioritized the primary supplier who can deliver 40 tons within 2 weeks. The remaining 25 tons (65 - 40) are ordered from the secondary supplier, who has a longer lead time but can fulfill the remaining quantity.",
        "additionalNotes": "Ordering from both suppliers is necessary to meet the total demand. Prioritizing the primary supplier ensures that a significant portion of the order arrives sooner, while the secondary supplier covers the remaining need. This approach balances timeliness and fulfillment."

    "question4": {
        "requiredProducts": [
            {
                "product": "Strawberry flats",

                "unit": "4-lb containers"
            }
        ],
        "reasoning": "To calculate the weekly container needs, I divided the weekly pound requirement for each berry type by the respective container weight and rounded up to the nearest whole container to ensure sufficient supply. For strawberries: 420 lbs / 8 lbs/flat = 52.5 flats, rounded to 53 flats. For blueberries: 280 lbs / 5 lbs/container = 56 containers. For raspberries: 160 lbs / 4 lbs/container = 40 containers.",
        "additionalNotes": "Ordering whole containers ensures that the restaurant group receives at least the ordered quantity of berries each week. The weekly delivery schedule is crucial due to the 7-day shelf life of fresh berries, minimizing potential spoilage and waste."

    "question5": {
        "requiredProducts": [
            {
                "product": "Extra Virgin olive oil",
                "quantity": 16,
                "unit": "55-gallon drums"

                "product": "Pure olive oil",
                "quantity": 9,
                "unit": "55-gallon drums"
            }
        ],
        "reasoning": "I aimed to minimize the number of containers while meeting the demand for each olive oil grade and staying within the 40-container limit. For Extra Virgin: 860 gallons / 55 gallons/drum = 15.64 drums, rounded to 16 drums. For Virgin: 520 gallons / 35 gallons/drum = 14.86 drums, rounded to 15 drums. For Pure: 340 gallons / 55 gallons/drum = 6.18 drums, rounded up initially to 7, but to maximize container usage within the limit and better meet demand, I adjusted to 9 drums. Total containers: 16 + 15 + 9 = 40.",
        "additionalNotes": "This container mix optimally utilizes the warehouse space by reaching the 40-container limit exactly. Using larger drums where possible minimizes the total number of containers needed, simplifying storage and handling while ensuring sufficient olive oil to meet the forecasted demand for each grade."
