                "unit": "cases"
            }
        ],
        "reasoning": "I calculated the number of cases by dividing the requested weight by the case weight and rounding up to the nearest whole case. Red Delicious: 8,500 lbs ÷ 42 lbs/case = 203 cases. Gala: 7,200 lbs ÷ 42 lbs/case = 172 cases. Granny Smith: 5,300 lbs ÷ 38 lbs/case = 140 cases.",
        "additionalNotes": "This order will result in a small amount of excess product: 26 lbs of Red Delicious, 24 lbs of Gala, and 20 lbs of Granny Smith. This should be accounted for in inventory planning."

        "requiredProducts": [
            {
                "product": "Roma tomatoes from Supplier A",

                "unit": "lbs"
            }
        ],
        "reasoning": "I selected suppliers meeting the minimum 6.2% solids requirement. Supplier C's tomatoes (6.1%) don't meet specifications. To minimize cost while meeting the 18,500 lb requirement, I ordered all 12,000 lbs from Supplier A and the remaining 6,500 lbs from Supplier B.",
        "additionalNotes": "While Supplier B offers a lower price than Supplier A, both must be used to fulfill the total quantity needed. The total cost is $14,870 (12,000 lbs × $0.82 + 6,500 lbs × $0.78)."

                "unit": "tons"
            }
        ],
        "reasoning": "Total customer orders equal 79 tons (28 + 16 + 35). With 14 tons in inventory, we need to source 65 additional tons. I ordered the maximum 40 tons from the primary supplier due to faster delivery time, and the remaining 25 tons from the secondary supplier.",
        "additionalNotes": "The primary supplier's shorter lead time (2 weeks vs 3 weeks) makes it preferable to maximize their allocation. Orders should be placed immediately to ensure timely delivery, especially from the secondary supplier."

                "unit": "4-lb containers"
            }
        ],
        "reasoning": "I calculated the number of containers needed weekly by dividing the weekly requirement by the container size and rounding up to the nearest whole container. Strawberries: 420 lbs ÷ 8 lbs/flat = 53 flats. Blueberries: 280 lbs ÷ 5 lbs/container = 56 containers. Raspberries: 160 lbs ÷ 4 lbs/container = 40 containers.",
        "additionalNotes": "The 7-day shelf life aligns perfectly with the weekly delivery schedule. This order provides exactly the required amount for raspberries and minimal excess for strawberries (4 lbs) and blueberries (0 lbs)."

                "unit": "55-gallon drums"
            }
        ],
        "reasoning": "I selected container sizes to minimize the total number of containers while meeting volume requirements. For Extra Virgin, 16 55-gallon drums provide 880 gallons (860 needed). For Virgin, 15 35-gallon drums provide 525 gallons (520 needed). For Pure, 9 55-gallon drums provide 495 gallons (340 needed).",
        "additionalNotes": "This configuration uses exactly 40 containers, maximizing storage capacity. There is some excess oil (20 gallons of Extra Virgin, 5 gallons of Virgin, and 155 gallons of Pure), but this is unavoidable given the container size constraints."
