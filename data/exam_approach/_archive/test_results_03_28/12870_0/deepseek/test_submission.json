        "question1": "In the music industry, typical commission rates for agents range from 10% to 20%, with a recent trend towards the lower end due to increased competition. In film, agents typically charge 10% for domestic deals and 15% for international deals, with no significant recent shifts. In professional sports, agents usually take 3% to 5% of the athlete's contract, with some leagues capping the rate at 4% to protect athletes.",
        "question2": "Three streaming platforms that have significantly changed their content acquisition strategy include Netflix, which has increased its investment in original content to reduce reliance on licensed material; Disney+, which has focused on exclusive releases of major franchises like Marvel and Star Wars; and Amazon Prime Video, which has expanded into live sports streaming. These changes have led to more competitive bidding for exclusive content, potentially increasing leverage for artists and performers in deal negotiations.",
        "question3": "The current standard revenue split between artists and labels/publishers in the music industry is typically 15% to 25% for artists, with the remainder going to the label. This has shifted slightly in recent years due to the rise of streaming, with some labels offering better terms to retain top talent, but the overall structure remains largely unchanged.",
