    - Don't refer to specific software brands, rather give the general category of tools required for the task. 
    - Also, only list tools that are absolutetly crucial, i.e. there is no way the task could be performed without them.

4. **Digital content formats required**

For each example, provide a list of the formats of the digital content that the worker needs to work with to complete the task.
Examples of formats of digital content are data files, PDFs, images, audio files, information.
- Don't refer to digital content formats specific to the task, rather give a generally applicable content format.

5. **Artefactss**
For each example, provide a list of types of artefacts that can be used to assess whether the task has successfully been completed or not.
Examples of types artefacts are sent emails, spreadsheets, numbers or text documents.
- Don't refer to artefacts specific to the task, rather give generally applicable types of artefacts.
